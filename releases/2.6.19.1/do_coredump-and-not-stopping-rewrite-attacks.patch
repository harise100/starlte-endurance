Heh, the very first line:
fs/exec.c(1465): remark #593: variable "flag" was set but never used

fs/exec.c:
  1477		/*
  1478		 *	We cannot trust fsuid as being the "true" uid of the
  1479		 *	process nor do we know its entire history. We only know it
  1480		 *	was tainted so we dump it as root in mode 2.
  1481		 */
  1482		if (mm->dumpable == 2) {	/* Setuid core dump mode */
  1483			flag = O_EXCL;		/* Stop rewrite attacks */
  1484			current->fsuid = 0;	/* Dump root private */
  1485		}

And then filp_open follows with "flag" totally ignored.
