Subject: xfs: report zeroed or not correctly in xfs_zero_range()

From: Eryu Guan <eguan@redhat.com>

commit d20a5e3851969fa685f118a80e4df670255a4e8d upstream.

The 'did_zero' param of xfs_zero_range() was not passed to
iomap_zero_range() correctly. This was introduced by commit
7bb41db3ea16 ("xfs: handle 64-bit length in xfs_iozero"), and found
by code inspection.
