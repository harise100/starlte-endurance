Subject: rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix connection lost problem

From: Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>

commit b8b8b16352cd90c6083033fd4487f04fae935c18 upstream.

In commit 40b368af4b75 ("rtlwifi: Fix alignment issues"), the read
of REG_DBI_READ was changed from 16 to 8 bits. For unknown reasonsi
this change results in reduced stability for the wireless connection.
This regression was located using bisection.
