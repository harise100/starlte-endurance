From: Ross Zwisler <ross.zwisler@linux.intel.com>

commit d0f0931de936a0a468d7e59284d39581c16d3a73 upstream.

When the pmd_devmap() checks were added by 5c7fb56e5e3f ("mm, dax:
dax-pmd vs thp-pmd vs hugetlbfs-pmd") to add better support for DAX huge
pages, they were all added to the end of if() statements after existing
pmd_trans_huge() checks.  So, things like:

  -       if (pmd_trans_huge(*pmd))
  +       if (pmd_trans_huge(*pmd) || pmd_devmap(*pmd))

When further checks were added after pmd_trans_unstable() checks by
commit 7267ec008b5c ("mm: postpone page table allocation until we have
page to map") they were also added at the end of the conditional:

  +       if (pmd_trans_unstable(fe->pmd) || pmd_devmap(*fe->pmd))

This ordering is fine for pmd_trans_huge(), but doesn't work for
pmd_trans_unstable().  This is because DAX huge pages trip the bad_pmd()
check inside of pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() (called by
pmd_trans_unstable()), which prints out a warning and returns 1.  So, we
do end up doing the right thing, but only after spamming dmesg with
suspicious looking messages:

  mm/pgtable-generic.c:39: bad pmd ffff8808daa49b88(84000001006000a5)

Reorder these checks in a helper so that pmd_devmap() is checked first,
avoiding the error messages, and add a comment explaining why the
ordering is important.

Fixes: commit 7267ec008b5c ("mm: postpone page table allocation until we have page to map")
