Subject: sbp2: backport read_capacity workaround for iPod

There is a firmware bug in several Apple iPods which prevents access to
these iPods under certain conditions. The disk size reported by the iPod
is one sector too big. Once access to the end of the disk is attempted,
the iPod becomes inaccessible. This problem has been known for USB iPods
for some time and has recently been discovered to exist with
FireWire/USB combo iPods too.

This patch is derived from the fix in Linux 2.6.17, commit
e9a1c52c7b19d10342226c12f170d7ab644427e2, to be applicable to 2.6.16.x
without prerequisite patches. It hard-wires a workaround for three known
affected model numbers (those of 4th generation iPod, iPod Photo, iPod
mini).

Note: This patch lacks Linux 2.6.17's ability to enable and disable the
workaround via a module parameter.
