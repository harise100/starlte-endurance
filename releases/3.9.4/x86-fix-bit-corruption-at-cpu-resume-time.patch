Subject: x86: Fix bit corruption at CPU resume time

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 5e427ec2d066b48a5c27b3a5a3315f7e4e729077 upstream.

In commit 78d77df71510 ("x86-64, init: Do not set NX bits on non-NX
capable hardware") we added the early_pmd_flags that gets the NX bit set
when a CPU supports NX. However, the new variable was marked __initdata,
because the main _use_ of this is in an __init routine.

However, the bit setting happens from secondary_startup_64(), which is
called not only at bootup, but on every secondary CPU start.  Including
resuming from STR and at CPU hotplug time.  So the value cannot be
__initdata.
