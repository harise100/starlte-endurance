Subject: NETFILTER: xt_time: fix failure to match on Sundays

From: Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@computergmbh.de>
Upstream commit 4f4c9430:

xt_time_match() in net/netfilter/xt_time.c in kernel 2.6.24 never
matches on Sundays. On my host I have a rule like

iptables -A OUTPUT -m time --weekdays Sun -j REJECT

and it never matches. The problem is in localtime_2(), which uses

    r->weekday = (4 + r->dse) % 7;

to map the epoch day onto a weekday in {0,...,6}. In particular this
gives 0 for Sundays. But 0 has to be wrong; a weekday of 0 can never
match. xt_time_match() has

    if (!(info->weekdays_match & (1 << current_time.weekday)))
        return false;

and when current_time.weekday = 0, the result of the & is always
zero, even when info->weekdays_match = XT_TIME_ALL_WEEKDAYS = 0xFE.
