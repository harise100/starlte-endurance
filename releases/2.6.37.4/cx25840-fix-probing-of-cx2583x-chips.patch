Subject: [media] cx25840: fix probing of cx2583x chips

From: Sven Barth <pascaldragon@googlemail.com>

commit 1e6406b8f0dc1ae7d7c39c9e1ac6ca78e016ebfb upstream.

Fix the probing of cx2583x chips, because two controls were clustered
that are not created for these chips.

This regression was introduced in 2.6.36.
