Subject: ALSA: hda - Don't set to D3 in Cirrus errata init verbs

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 38c07641905c0db58e800ea974cd9158717c6610 upstream.

The errata init verbs for CS42xx codecs contain the verbs to set
the power-state of SPDIF nodes to D3, which seem to break the SPDIF
output on some MacBooks.  Since this is executed during the power-up
initialization, we shouldn't turn them down there.
