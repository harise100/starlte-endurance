Subject: [S390] keyboard: integer underflow bug

From: Dan Carpenter <error27@gmail.com>

commit b652277b09d3d030cb074cc6a98ba80b34244c03 upstream.

The "ct" variable should be an unsigned int.  Both struct kbdiacrs
->kb_cnt and struct kbd_data ->accent_table_size are unsigned ints.

Making it signed causes a problem in KBDIACRUC because the user could
set the signed bit and cause a buffer overflow.
