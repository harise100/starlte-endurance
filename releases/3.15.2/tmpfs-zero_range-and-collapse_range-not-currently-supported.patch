Subject: tmpfs: ZERO_RANGE and COLLAPSE_RANGE not currently supported

From: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

commit 13ace4d0d9db40e10ecd66dfda14e297571be813 upstream.

I was well aware of FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE and FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE
support being added to fallocate(); but didn't realize until now that I
had been too stupid to future-proof shmem_fallocate() against new
additions.  -EOPNOTSUPP instead of going on to ordinary fallocation.
