Subject: parisc: Fix system shutdown halt

From: Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>

commit 73580dac7618e4bcd21679f553cf3c97323fec46 upstream.

On those parisc machines which don't provide a software power off
function, the system currently kills the init process at the end of a
shutdown and unexpectedly restarts insteads of halting.
Fix it by adding a loop which will not return.
