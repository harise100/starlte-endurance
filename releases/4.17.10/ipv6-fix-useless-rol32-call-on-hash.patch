Subject: ipv6: fix useless rol32 call on hash

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

[ Upstream commit 169dc027fb02492ea37a0575db6a658cf922b854 ]

The rol32 call is currently rotating hash but the rol'd value is
being discarded. I believe the current code is incorrect and hash
should be assigned the rotated value returned from rol32.

Thanks to David Lebrun for spotting this.
