Subject: USB: qmi_wwan: Add ZTE (Vodafone) K3765-Z

From: "Andrew Bird (Sphere Systems)" <ajb@spheresystems.co.uk>

commit 8965c98fdebedce077257241957b205515dd1a5f upstream.

Add the ZTE (Vodafone) K3765-Z to the whitelist. This requires the
previous patch to make the whitelist with forced interface 4 generic
or the device fails to initialise. After applying this patch and
loading the Option driver without usb-modeswitch's bind all
interfaces trick, a wwan0 net interface and /dev/cdc-wdm0 device
file were created. Using Bjorn Mork's perl connection script a
connection was made to a mobile network using QMI and the network
interface's IPv4 address was configured OK.
