Subject: mm: avoid swapping out with swappiness==0

From: Satoru Moriya <satoru.moriya@hds.com>

commit fe35004fbf9eaf67482b074a2e032abb9c89b1dd upstream.

Sometimes we'd like to avoid swapping out anonymous memory.  In
particular, avoid swapping out pages of important process or process
groups while there is a reasonable amount of pagecache on RAM so that we
can satisfy our customers' requirements.

OTOH, we can control how aggressive the kernel will swap memory pages with
/proc/sys/vm/swappiness for global and
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.swappiness for each memcg.

But with current reclaim implementation, the kernel may swap out even if
we set swappiness=0 and there is pagecache in RAM.

This patch changes the behavior with swappiness==0.  If we set
swappiness==0, the kernel does not swap out completely (for global reclaim
until the amount of free pages and filebacked pages in a zone has been
reduced to something very very small (nr_free + nr_filebacked < high
watermark)).
