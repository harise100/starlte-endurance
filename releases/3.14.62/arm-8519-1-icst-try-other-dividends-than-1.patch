Subject: ARM: 8519/1: ICST: try other dividends than 1

From: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

commit e972c37459c813190461dabfeaac228e00aae259 upstream.

Since the dawn of time the ICST code has only supported divide
by one or hang in an eternal loop. Luckily we were always dividing
by one because the reference frequency for the systems using
the ICSTs is 24MHz and the [min,max] values for the PLL input
if [10,320] MHz for ICST307 and [6,200] for ICST525, so the loop
will always terminate immediately without assigning any divisor
for the reference frequency.

But for the code to make sense, let's insert the missing i++
