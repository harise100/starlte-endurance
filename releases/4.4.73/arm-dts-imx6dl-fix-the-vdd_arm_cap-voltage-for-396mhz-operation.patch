Subject: ARM: dts: imx6dl: Fix the VDD_ARM_CAP voltage for 396MHz operation

From: Fabio Estevam <fabio.estevam@nxp.com>

commit 46350b71a09ccf3573649e03db55d4b61d5da231 upstream.

Table 8 from MX6DL datasheet (IMX6SDLCEC Rev. 5, 06/2015):
http://cache.nxp.com/files/32bit/doc/data_sheet/IMX6SDLCEC.pdf

states the following:

"LDO Output Set Point (VDD_ARM_CAP) = 1.125 V minimum for operation
up to 396 MHz."

So fix the entry by adding the 25mV margin value as done in the other
entries of the table, which results in 1.15V for 396MHz operation.
