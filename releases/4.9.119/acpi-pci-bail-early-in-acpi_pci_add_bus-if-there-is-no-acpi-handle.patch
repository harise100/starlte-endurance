Subject: ACPI / PCI: Bail early in acpi_pci_add_bus() if there is no ACPI handle

From: Vitaly Kuznetsov <vkuznets@redhat.com>

commit a0040c0145945d3bd203df8fa97f6dfa819f3f7d upstream.

Hyper-V instances support PCI pass-through which is implemented through PV
pci-hyperv driver. When a device is passed through, a new root PCI bus is
created in the guest. The bus sits on top of VMBus and has no associated
information in ACPI. acpi_pci_add_bus() in this case proceeds all the way
to acpi_evaluate_dsm(), which reports

  ACPI: \: failed to evaluate _DSM (0x1001)

While acpi_pci_slot_enumerate() and acpiphp_enumerate_slots() are protected
against ACPI_HANDLE() being NULL and do nothing, acpi_evaluate_dsm() is not
and gives us the error. It seems the correct fix is to not do anything in
acpi_pci_add_bus() in such cases.
