Subject: Revert "drm/i915: reverse dp link param selection, prefer fast over wide again"

From: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>

commit c6930992948adf0f8fc1f6ff1da51c5002a2cf95 upstream.

This reverts commit 38aecea0ccbb909d635619cba22f1891e589b434.

This breaks Haswell Thinkpad + Lenovo dock in SST mode with a HDMI monitor attached.

Before this we can 1920x1200 mode, after this we only ever get 1024x768, and
a lot of deferring.

This didn't revert clean, but this should be fine.
