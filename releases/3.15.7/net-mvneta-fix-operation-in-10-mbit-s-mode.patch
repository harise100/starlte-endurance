Subject: net: mvneta: fix operation in 10 Mbit/s mode

From: Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@free-electrons.com>

[ Upstream commit 4d12bc63ab5e48c1d78fa13883cf6fefcea3afb1 ]

As reported by Maggie Mae Roxas, the mvneta driver doesn't behave
properly in 10 Mbit/s mode. This is due to a misconfiguration of the
MVNETA_GMAC_AUTONEG_CONFIG register: bit MVNETA_GMAC_CONFIG_MII_SPEED
must be set for a 100 Mbit/s speed, but cleared for a 10 Mbit/s speed,
which the driver was not properly doing. This commit adjusts that by
setting the MVNETA_GMAC_CONFIG_MII_SPEED bit only in 100 Mbit/s mode,
and relying on the fact that all the speed related bits of this
register are cleared at the beginning of the mvneta_adjust_link()
function.

This problem exists since c5aff18204da0 ("net: mvneta: driver for
Marvell Armada 370/XP network unit") which is the commit that
introduced the mvneta driver in the kernel.
