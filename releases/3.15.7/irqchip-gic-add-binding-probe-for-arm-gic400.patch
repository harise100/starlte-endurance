Subject: irqchip: gic: Add binding probe for ARM GIC400

From: Suravee Suthikulpanit <Suravee.Suthikulpanit@amd.com>

commit 144cb08864ed44be52d8634ac69cd98e5efcf527 upstream.

Commit 3ab72f9156bb "dt-bindings: add GIC-400 binding" added the
"arm,gic-400" compatible string, but the corresponding IRQCHIP_DECLARE
was never added to the gic driver.

Therefore add the missing irqchip declaration for it.
