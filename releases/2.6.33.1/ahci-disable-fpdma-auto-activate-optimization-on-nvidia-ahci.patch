Subject: ahci: disable FPDMA auto-activate optimization on NVIDIA AHCI

From: Robert Hancock <hancockrwd@gmail.com>

commit 453d3131ec7aab82eaaa8401a50522a337092aa8 upstream.

Mike Cui reported that his system with an NVIDIA MCP79 (aka MCP7A)
chipset stopped working with 2.6.32. The problem appears to be that
2.6.32 now enables the FPDMA auto-activate optimization in the ahci
driver. The drive works fine with this enabled on an Intel AHCI so
this appears to be a chipset bug.  Since MCP79 is a fairly recent
NVIDIA chipset and we don't have any info on whether any other NVIDIA
chipsets have this issue, disable FPDMA AA optimization on all NVIDIA
AHCI controllers for now.

Should address http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14922
