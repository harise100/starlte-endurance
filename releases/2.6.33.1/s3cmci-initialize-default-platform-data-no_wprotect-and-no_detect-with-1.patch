Subject: s3cmci: initialize default platform data no_wprotect and no_detect with 1

From: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de>

commit c212808a1ba6bfba489006399b8152a047305acf upstream.

If no platform_data was givin to the device it's going to use it's default
platform data struct which has all fields initialized to zero.  As a
result the driver is going to try to request gpio0 both as write protect
and card detect pin.  Which of course will fail and makes the driver
unusable

Previously to the introduction of no_wprotect and no_detect the behavior
was to assume that if no platform data was given there is no write protect
or card detect pin.  This patch restores that behavior.
