Subject: ocfs2: Only bug out in direct io write for reflinked extent.

From: Tao Ma <tao.ma@oracle.com>

commit cbaee472f274ea9a98aabe47025f6e5551acadcb upstream.

In ocfs2_direct_IO_get_blocks, we only need to bug out
in case of we are going to write a recounted extent rec.

What a silly bug introduced by me!
