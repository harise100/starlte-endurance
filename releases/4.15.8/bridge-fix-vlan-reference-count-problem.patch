Subject: bridge: Fix VLAN reference count problem

From: Ido Schimmel <idosch@mellanox.com>


[ Upstream commit 0e5a82efda872c2469c210957d7d4161ef8f4391 ]

When a VLAN is added on a port, a reference is taken on the
corresponding master VLAN entry. If it does not already exist, then it
is created and a reference taken.

However, in the second case a reference is not really taken when
CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL is enabled as refcount_inc() is replaced by
refcount_inc_not_zero().

Fix this by using refcount_set() on a newly created master VLAN entry.

Fixes: 251277598596 ("net, bridge: convert net_bridge_vlan.refcnt from atomic_t to refcount_t")
