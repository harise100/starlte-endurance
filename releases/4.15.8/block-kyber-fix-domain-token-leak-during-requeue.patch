Subject: block: kyber: fix domain token leak during requeue

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>

commit ba989a01469d027861e55c8f1121edadef757797 upstream.

When requeuing request, the domain token should have been freed
before re-inserting the request to io scheduler. Otherwise, the
assigned domain token will be leaked, and IO hang can be caused.
