Subject: pinctrl: sh-pfc: only use dummy states for non-DT platforms

From: Wolfram Sang <wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>

commit 0129801be4b87226bf502f18f5a9eabd356d1058 upstream.

If pinctrl_provide_dummies() is used unconditionally, then the dummy
state will be used even on DT platforms when the "init" state was
intentionally left out. Instead of "default", the dummy "init" state
will then be used during probe. Thus, when probing an I2C controller on
cold boot, communication triggered by bus notifiers broke because the
pins were not initialized.

Do it like OMAP2: use the dummy state only for non-DT platforms.

Fixes: ef0eebc05130 ("drivers/pinctrl: Add the concept of an "init" state")
