Subject: ALSA: usb-audio: Skip volume controls triggers hangup on Dell USB Dock

From: Kailang Yang <kailang@realtek.com>

commit adcdd0d5a1cb779f6d455ae70882c19c527627a8 upstream.

This is Dell usb dock audio workaround.
It was fixed the master volume keep lower.

[Some background: the patch essentially skips the controls of a couple
 of FU volumes.  Although the firmware exposes the dB and the value
 information via the usb descriptor, changing the values (we set the
 min volume as default) screws up the device.  Although this has been
 fixed in the newer firmware, the devices are shipped with the old
 firmware, thus we need the workaround in the driver side.  -- tiwai]
