Subject: iio: fix config watermark initial value

From: Irina Tirdea <irina.tirdea@intel.com>

commit 1bef2c1d4e4fd92bdf8219b13ba97ba861618254 upstream.

config structure is set to 0 when updating the buffers, so by
default config->watermark will be 0. When computing the minimum
between config->watermark and the buffer->watermark or
insert_buffer-watermark, this will always be 0 regardless of the
value set by the user for the buffer.

Set as initial value for config->watermark the maximum allowed
value so that the minimum value will always be set from one of the
buffers.
