Subject: bsdacct: fix uid/gid misreporting

From: Alexey Dobriyan <adobriyan@gmail.com>

commit 4b731d50ff3df6b9141a6c12b088e8eb0109e83c upstream.

commit d8e180dcd5bbbab9cd3ff2e779efcf70692ef541 "bsdacct: switch
credentials for writing to the accounting file" introduced credential
switching during final acct data collecting.  However, uid/gid pair
continued to be collected from current which became credentials of who
created acct file, not who exits.
