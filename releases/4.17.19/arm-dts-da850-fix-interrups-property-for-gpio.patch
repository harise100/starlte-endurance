Subject: ARM: dts: da850: Fix interrups property for gpio

From: Keerthy <j-keerthy@ti.com>

[ Upstream commit 3eb1b955cd7ed1e621ace856710006c2a8a7f231 ]

The intc #interrupt-cells is equal to 1. Currently gpio
node has 2 cells per IRQ which is wrong. Remove the additional
cell for each of the interrupts.
