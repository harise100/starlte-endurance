Subject: RISC-V: Don't include irq-riscv-intc.h

From: Palmer Dabbelt <palmer@sifive.com>

[ Upstream commit 8606544890d7dc4f7a740963f70dc1e1d54f8e30 ]

This file has never existed in the upstream kernel, but it's guarded by
an #ifdef that's also never existed in the upstream kernel.  As a part
of our interrupt controller refactoring this header is no longer
necessary, but this reference managed to sneak in anyway.
