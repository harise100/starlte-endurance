Subject: x86, memory hotplug: remove wrong -1 in calling init_memory_mapping()

From: Shaohua Li <shaohua.li@intel.com>

commit 60817c9b31ef7897d60bca2f384cbc316a3fdd8b upstream.

Impact: fix crash with memory hotplug

Shuahua Li found:

| I just did some experiments on a desktop for memory hotplug and this bug
| triggered a crash in my test.
|
| Yinghai's suggestion also fixed the bug.

We don't need to round it, just remove that extra -1
