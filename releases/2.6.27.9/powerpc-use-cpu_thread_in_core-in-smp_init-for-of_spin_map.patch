Subject: powerpc: Use cpu_thread_in_core in smp_init for of_spin_map

From: Milton Miller <miltonm@bga.com>

commit 6a75a6b8e85e92cc774d42a4e113c76c30b5a539 upstream.

We used to assume that even numbered threads were the primary
threads, ie those that would be listed and started as a cpu from
open firmware.  Replace a left over is even (% 2) check with a check
for it being a primary thread and update the comments.

Tested with a debug print on pseries, identical code found for cell.
