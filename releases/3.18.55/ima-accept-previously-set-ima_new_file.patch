Subject: ima: accept previously set IMA_NEW_FILE

commit 1ac202e978e18f045006d75bd549612620c6ec3a upstream.

Modifying the attributes of a file makes ima_inode_post_setattr reset
the IMA cache flags. So if the file, which has just been created,
is opened a second time before the first file descriptor is closed,
verification fails since the security.ima xattr has not been written
yet. We therefore have to look at the IMA_NEW_FILE even if the file
already existed.

With this patch there should no longer be an error when cat tries to
open testfile:

$ rm -f testfile
$ ( echo test >&3 ; touch testfile ; cat testfile ) 3>testfile

A file being new is no reason to accept that it is missing a digital
signature demanded by the policy.
