Subject: iommu/vt-d: Defer domain removal if device is assigned to a driver

From: Joerg Roedel <jroedel@suse.de>

commit e7f9fa5498d91fcdc63d93007ba43f36b1a30538 upstream.

When the BUS_NOTIFY_DEL_DEVICE event is received the device
might still be attached to a driver. In this case the domain
can't be released as the mappings might still be in use.

Defer the domain removal in this case until we receivce the
BUS_NOTIFY_UNBOUND_DRIVER event.
