Subject: md/raid10: Fix memory leak when raid10 reshape completes.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit b39685526f46976bcd13aa08c82480092befa46c upstream.

When a raid10 commences a resync/recovery/reshape it allocates
some buffer space.
When a resync/recovery completes the buffer space is freed.  But not
when the reshape completes.
This can result in a small memory leak.

There is a subtle side-effect of this bug.  When a RAID10 is reshaped
to a larger array (more devices), the reshape is immediately followed
by a "resync" of the new space.  This "resync" will use the buffer
space which was allocated for "reshape".  This can cause problems
including a "BUG" in the SCSI layer.  So this is suitable for -stable.
