Subject: scsi_scan: Restrict sequential scan to 256 LUNs

From: Hannes Reinecke <hare@suse.de>

commit 22ffeb48b7584d6cd50f2a595ed6065d86a87459 upstream.

Sequential scan for more than 256 LUNs is very fragile as
LUNs might not be numbered sequentially after that point.

SAM revisions later than SCSI-3 impose a structure on
LUNs larger than 256, making LUN numbers between 256
and 16384 illegal.
SCSI-3, however allows for plain 64-bit numbers with
no internal structure.

So restrict sequential LUN scan to 256 LUNs and add a
new blacklist flag 'BLIST_SCSI3LUN' to scan up to
max_lun devices.
