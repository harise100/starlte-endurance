Subject: [SCSI] sd name space exhaustion causes system hang

From: Michael Reed <mdr@sgi.com>

commit 1a03ae0f556a931aa3747b70e44b78308f5b0590 upstream.

Following a site power outage which re-enabled all the ports on my FC
switches, my system subsequently booted with far too many luns!  I had
let it run hoping it would make multi-user.  It didn't.  :(  It hung solid
after exhausting the last sd device, sdzzz, and attempting to create sdaaaa
and beyond.  I was unable to get a dump.

Discovered using a 2.6.32.13 based system.

correct this by detecting when the last index is utilized and failing
the sd probe of the device.  Patch applies to scsi-misc-2.6.
