Subject: drm/i915/lvds: Only act on lid notify when the device is on

From: Alex Williamson <alex.williamson@redhat.com>

commit 2fb4e61d9471867677c97bf11dba8f1e9dfa7f7c upstream.

If we're using vga switcheroo, the device may be turned off
and poking it can return random state. This provokes an OOPS fixed
separately by 8ff887c847 (drm/i915/dp: Be paranoid in case we disable a
DP before it is attached). Trying to use and respond to events on a
device that has been turned off by the user is in principle a silly thing
to do.
