Subject: tmpfs: fix race between umount and swapoff

From: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

commit 778dd893ae785c5fd505dac30b5fc40aae188bf1 upstream.

The use of igrab() in swapoff's shmem_unuse_inode() is just as vulnerable
to umount as that in shmem_writepage().

Fix this instance by extending the protection of shmem_swaplist_mutex
right across shmem_unuse_inode(): while it's on the list, the inode cannot
be evicted (and the filesystem cannot be unmounted) without
shmem_evict_inode() taking that mutex to remove it from the list.

But since shmem_writepage() might take that mutex, we should avoid making
memory allocations or memcg charges while holding it: prepare them at the
outer level in shmem_unuse().  When mem_cgroup_cache_charge() was
originally placed, we didn't know until that point that the page from swap
was actually a shmem page; but nowadays it's noted in the swap_map, so
we're safe to charge upfront.  For the radix_tree, do as is done in
shmem_getpage(): preload upfront, but don't pin to the cpu; so we make a
habit of refreshing the node pool, but might dip into GFP_NOWAIT reserves
on occasion if subsequently preempted.

With the allocation and charge moved out from shmem_unuse_inode(),
we can also hold index map and info->lock over from finding the entry.
