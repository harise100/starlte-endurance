Subject: ASoC: UDA134x: Remove POWER_OFF_ON_STANDBY define.

From: Marek Belisko <marek.belisko@open-nandra.com>

commit bf707de21fec7bb203dace2d0a2bbd124d1b36ca upstream.

Define POWER_OFF_ON_STANDBY cause trobles when trying to get some
sound from codec because code for bias setup was not compiled
(define wasn't defined). This define was removed in commit:
cc3202f5 but again introduced by commit: f0fba2ad1 which then
completely break codec functionality so remove it again.
