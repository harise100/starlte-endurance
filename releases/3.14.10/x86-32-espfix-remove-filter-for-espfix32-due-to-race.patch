Subject: x86-32, espfix: Remove filter for espfix32 due to race

From: "H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@linux.intel.com>

commit 246f2d2ee1d715e1077fc47d61c394569c8ee692 upstream.

It is not safe to use LAR to filter when to go down the espfix path,
because the LDT is per-process (rather than per-thread) and another
thread might change the descriptors behind our back.  Fortunately it
is always *safe* (if a bit slow) to go down the espfix path, and a
32-bit LDT stack segment is extremely rare.
