Subject: net: fec: clear receive interrupts before processing a packet

From: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>

[ Upstream commit ed63f1dcd5788d36f942fbcce350742385e3e18c ]

The patch just to re-submit the patch "db3421c114cfa6326" because the
patch "4d494cdc92b3b9a0" remove the change.

Clear any pending receive interrupt before we process a pending packet.
This helps to avoid any spurious interrupts being raised after we have
fully cleaned the receive ring, while still allowing an interrupt to be
raised if we receive another packet.

The position of this is critical: we must do this prior to reading the
next packet status to avoid potentially dropping an interrupt when a
packet is still pending.
