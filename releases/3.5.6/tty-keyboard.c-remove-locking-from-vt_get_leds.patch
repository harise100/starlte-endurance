Subject: tty: keyboard.c: Remove locking from vt_get_leds.

From: Christopher Brannon <chris@the-brannons.com>

commit 157a4b311c45c9aba75a990464d9680867dc8805 upstream.

There are three call sites for this function, and all three
are called within a keyboard handler.
kbd_event_lock is already held within keyboard handlers,
so attempting to lock it in vt_get_leds causes deadlock.
