Subject: splice: Apply generic position and size checks to each write

From: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>

commit 894c6350eaad7e613ae267504014a456e00a3e2a from the 3.2-stable branch.

We need to check the position and size of file writes against various
limits, using generic_write_check().  This was not being done for
the splice write path.  It was fixed upstream by commit 8d0207652cbe
("->splice_write() via ->write_iter()") but we can't apply that.

CVE-2014-7822
