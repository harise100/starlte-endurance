Subject: cpufreq: Revert commit a66b2e to fix suspend/resume regression

From: "Srivatsa S. Bhat" <srivatsa.bhat@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit aae760ed21cd690fe8a6db9f3a177ad55d7e12ab upstream.

commit a66b2e (cpufreq: Preserve sysfs files across suspend/resume)
has unfortunately caused several things in the cpufreq subsystem to
break subtly after a suspend/resume cycle.

The intention of that patch was to retain the file permissions of the
cpufreq related sysfs files across suspend/resume.  To achieve that,
the commit completely removed the calls to cpufreq_add_dev() and
__cpufreq_remove_dev() during suspend/resume transitions.  But the
problem is that those functions do 2 kinds of things:
  1. Low-level initialization/tear-down that are critical to the
     correct functioning of cpufreq-core.
  2. Kobject and sysfs related initialization/teardown.

Ideally we should have reorganized the code to cleanly separate these
two responsibilities, and skipped only the sysfs related parts during
suspend/resume.  Since we skipped the entire callbacks instead (which
also included some CPU and cpufreq-specific critical components),
cpufreq subsystem started behaving erratically after suspend/resume.

So revert the commit to fix the regression.  We'll revisit and address
the original goal of that commit separately, since it involves quite a
bit of careful code reorganization and appears to be non-trivial.

(While reverting the commit, note that another commit f51e1eb
 (cpufreq: Fix cpufreq regression after suspend/resume) already
 reverted part of the original set of changes.  So revert only the
 remaining ones).
