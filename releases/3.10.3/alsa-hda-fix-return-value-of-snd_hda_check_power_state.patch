Subject: ALSA: hda - Fix return value of snd_hda_check_power_state()

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 06ec56d3c60238f27bfa50d245592fccc1b4ef0f upstream.

The refactoring by commit 9040d102 introduced the new function
snd_hda_check_power_state().  This function is supposed to return true
if the state already reached to the target state, but it actually
returns false for that.  An utterly stupid typo while copy & paste.

Fortunately this didn't influence on much behavior because powering up
AFG usually powers up the child widgets, too.  But the finer power
control must have been broken by this bug.
