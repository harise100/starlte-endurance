Subject: ath9k: Do not assign noise for NULL caldata

From: Sujith Manoharan <c_manoha@qca.qualcomm.com>

commit d3bcb7b24bbf09fde8405770e676fe0c11c79662 upstream.

ah->noise is maintained globally and not per-channel. This
is updated in the reset() routine after the NF history has been
filled for the *current channel*, just before switching to
the new channel. There is no need to do it inside getnf(), since
ah->noise must contain a value for the new channel.
