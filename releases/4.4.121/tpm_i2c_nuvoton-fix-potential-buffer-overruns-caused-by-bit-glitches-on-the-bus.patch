Subject: tpm_i2c_nuvoton: fix potential buffer overruns caused by bit glitches on the bus

From: Jeremy Boone <jeremy.boone@nccgroup.trust>

commit f9d4d9b5a5ef2f017bc344fb65a58a902517173b upstream.

Discrete TPMs are often connected over slow serial buses which, on
some platforms, can have glitches causing bit flips.  In all the
driver _recv() functions, we need to use a u32 to unmarshal the
response size, otherwise a bit flip of the 31st bit would cause the
expected variable to go negative, which would then try to read a huge
amount of data.  Also sanity check that the expected amount of data is
large enough for the TPM header.
