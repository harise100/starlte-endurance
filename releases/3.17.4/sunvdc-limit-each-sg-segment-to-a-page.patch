Subject: sunvdc: limit each sg segment to a page

From: Dwight Engen <dwight.engen@oracle.com>

[ Upstream commit 5eed69ffd248c9f68f56c710caf07db134aef28b ]

ldc_map_sg() could fail its check that the number of pages referred to
by the sg scatterlist was <= the number of cookies.

This fixes the issue by doing a similar thing to the xen-blkfront driver,
ensuring that the scatterlist will only ever contain a segment count <=
port->ring_cookies, and each segment will be page aligned, and <= page
size. This ensures that the scatterlist is always mappable.
