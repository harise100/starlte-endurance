Subject: libata: Apply NOLPM quirk to Crucial MX100 512GB SSDs

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

commit 9c7be59fc519af9081c46c48f06f2b8fadf55ad8 upstream.

Various people have reported the Crucial MX100 512GB model not working
with LPM set to min_power. I've now received a report that it also does
not work with the new med_power_with_dipm level.

It does work with medium_power, but that has no measurable power-savings
and given the amount of people being bitten by the other levels not
working, this commit just disables LPM altogether.

Note all reporters of this have either the 512GB model (max capacity), or
are not specifying their SSD's size. So for now this quirk assumes this is
a problem with the 512GB model only.
