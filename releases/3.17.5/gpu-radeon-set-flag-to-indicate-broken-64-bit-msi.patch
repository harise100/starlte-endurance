Subject: gpu/radeon: Set flag to indicate broken 64-bit MSI

From: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>

commit 91ed6fd2c383bb8f02d66e98b4a4d2f7207249dc upstream.

Some radeon ASICs don't support all 64 address bits of MSIs despite
advertising support for 64-bit MSIs in their configuration space.

This breaks on systems such as IBM POWER7/8, where 64-bit MSIs can
be assigned with some of the high address bits set.

This makes use of the newly introduced "no_64bit_msi" flag in structure
pci_dev to allow the MSI allocation code to fallback to 32-bit MSIs
on those adapters.

Adding Alex's review tag. Patch to the driver is identical to the
reviewed one, I dropped the arch/powerpc hunk rewrote the subject
and cset comment.
