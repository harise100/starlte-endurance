Subject: ASoC: wm_adsp: Avoid attempt to free buffers that might still be in use

From: Charles Keepax <ckeepax@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

commit 9da7a5a9fdeeb76b2243f6b473363a7e6147ab6f upstream.

We should not free any buffers associated with writing out coefficients
to the DSP until all the async writes have completed. This patch updates
the out of memory path when allocating a new buffer to include a call to
regmap_async_complete.
