Subject: ext2: Fix oops in ext2_get_block() called from ext2_quota_write()

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit df4e7ac0bb70abc97fbfd9ef09671fc084b3f9db upstream.

ext2_quota_write() doesn't properly setup bh it passes to
ext2_get_block() and thus we hit assertion BUG_ON(maxblocks == 0) in
ext2_get_blocks() (or we could actually ask for mapping arbitrary number
of blocks depending on whatever value was on stack).

Fix ext2_quota_write() to properly fill in number of blocks to map.
