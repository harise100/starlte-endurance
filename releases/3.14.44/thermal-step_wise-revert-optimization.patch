Commit 178c2490b99f898efc06d1ad75cadc84f13021a6 ("thermal: step_wise:
cdev only needs update on a new target state") broke driver acerhdf.
That driver abused the step_wise thermal governor until the bang_bang
governor was available, and the optimization broke this usage model.

Kernels v3.12 to v3.18 are affected. In v3.19 the acerhdf driver was
switched to the bang_bang governor and that solved the problem.

For kernels v3.12 to v3.17, the bang_bang governor isn't available
yet so the easiest fix is to revert the optimization.

Please consider this patch for stable kernel branches from v3.12 to v3.17.

If anyone cares about v3.18, I think a better fix would be to backport
commit 48c8dd64345ba2a8c41556095c7adacb1c8af7c1 ("acerhdf: Use bang-bang
thermal governor") but it's too big for stable, so it's left to
distributions. So maybe this fix should make it into v3.18 stable as
well - I'll let whoever maintains that branch decide.
