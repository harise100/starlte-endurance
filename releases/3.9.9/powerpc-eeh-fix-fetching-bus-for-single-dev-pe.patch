Subject: powerpc/eeh: Fix fetching bus for single-dev-PE

From: Gavin Shan <shangw@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit ea461abf61753b4b79e625a7c20650105b990f21 upstream.

While running Linux as guest on top of phyp, we possiblly have
PE that includes single PCI device. However, we didn't return
its PCI bus correctly and it leads to failure on recovery from
EEH errors for single-dev-PE. The patch fixes the issue.
