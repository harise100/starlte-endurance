Subject: libceph: don't set weight to IN when OSD is destroyed

From: Ilya Dryomov <idryomov@gmail.com>

commit b581a5854eee4b7851dedb0f8c2ceb54fb902c06 upstream.

Since ceph.git commit 4e28f9e63644 ("osd/OSDMap: clear osd_info,
osd_xinfo on osd deletion"), weight is set to IN when OSD is deleted.
This changes the result of applying an incremental for clients, not
just OSDs.  Because CRUSH computations are obviously affected,
pre-4e28f9e63644 servers disagree with post-4e28f9e63644 clients on
object placement, resulting in misdirected requests.

Mirrors ceph.git commit a6009d1039a55e2c77f431662b3d6cc5a8e8e63f.

Fixes: 930c53286977 ("libceph: apply new_state before new_up_client on incrementals")
