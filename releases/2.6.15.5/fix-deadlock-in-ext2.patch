Subject: [PATCH] fix deadlock in ext2

From: Peter Staubach <staubach@redhat.com>

Fix a deadlock possible in the ext2 file system implementation.  This
deadlock occurs when a file is removed from an ext2 file system which was
mounted with the "sync" mount option.

The problem is that ext2_xattr_delete_inode() was invoking the routine,
sync_dirty_buffer(), using a buffer head which was previously locked via
lock_buffer().  The first thing that sync_dirty_buffer() does is to lock
the buffer head that it was passed.  It does this via lock_buffer().  Oops.

The solution is to unlock the buffer head in ext2_xattr_delete_inode()
before invoking sync_dirty_buffer().  This makes the code in
ext2_xattr_delete_inode() obey the same locking rules as all other callers
of sync_dirty_buffer() in the ext2 file system implementation.
