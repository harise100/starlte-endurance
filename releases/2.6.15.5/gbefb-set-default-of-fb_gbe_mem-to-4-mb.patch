Subject: [PATCH] gbefb: Set default of FB_GBE_MEM to 4 MB


From: Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com>

Allocating more than 4 MB memory for the GBE (SGI O2) framebuffer completely
breakfs gbefb support at the moment.  According to comments on #mipslinux,
more than 4 MB has never worked correctly in Linux.  Therefore, the default
should be 4 MB.
