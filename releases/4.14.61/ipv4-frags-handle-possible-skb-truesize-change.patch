Subject: ipv4: frags: handle possible skb truesize change

From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 4672694bd4f1aebdab0ad763ae4716e89cb15221 ]

ip_frag_queue() might call pskb_pull() on one skb that
is already in the fragment queue.

We need to take care of possible truesize change, or we
might have an imbalance of the netns frags memory usage.

IPv6 is immune to this bug, because RFC5722, Section 4,
amended by Errata ID 3089 states :

  When reassembling an IPv6 datagram, if
  one or more its constituent fragments is determined to be an
  overlapping fragment, the entire datagram (and any constituent
  fragments) MUST be silently discarded.

Fixes: 158f323b9868 ("net: adjust skb->truesize in pskb_expand_head()")
