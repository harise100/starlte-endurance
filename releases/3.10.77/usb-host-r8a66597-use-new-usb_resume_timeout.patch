Subject: usb: host: r8a66597: use new USB_RESUME_TIMEOUT

From: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>

commit 7a606ac29752a3e571b83f9b3fceb1eaa1d37781 upstream.

While this driver was already using a 50ms resume
timeout, let's make sure everybody uses the same
macro so it's easy to fix later should anything
go wrong.

It also gives a more "stable" expectation to Linux
users.
