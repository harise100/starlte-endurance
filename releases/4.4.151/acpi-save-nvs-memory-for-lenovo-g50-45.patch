Subject: ACPI: save NVS memory for Lenovo G50-45

From: Zhang Rui <rui.zhang@intel.com>

commit cbc00c1310d34139a63946482b40a6b261a03fb9 upstream.

In commit 821d6f0359b0 (ACPI / sleep: Do not save NVS for new machines to
accelerate S3), to optimize S3 suspend/resume speed, code is introduced
to ignore NVS memory saving during S3 for all the platforms later than
2012.

But, Lenovo G50-45, a platform released in 2015, still needs NVS memory
saving during S3. A quirk is introduced for this platform.
