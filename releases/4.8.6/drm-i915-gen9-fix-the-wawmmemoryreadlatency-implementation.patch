Subject: drm/i915/gen9: fix the WaWmMemoryReadLatency implementation

From: Paulo Zanoni <paulo.r.zanoni@intel.com>

commit 4e4d3814a9bb4d71cd3ff0701d8d7041edefd8f0 upstream.

Bspec says:
  "The mailbox response data may not account for memory read latency.
   If the mailbox response data for level 0 is 0us, add 2 microseconds
   to the result for each valid level."

This means we should only do the +2 in case wm[0] == 0, not always.

So split the sanitizing implementation from the WA implementation and
fix the WA implementation.

v2: Add Fixes tag (Maarten).

Fixes: 367294be7c25 ("drm/i915/gen9: Add 2us read latency to WM level")
