Subject: iio: ad5755: fix off-by-one on devnr limit check

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

commit 9d47964bfd471f0dd4c89f28556aec68bffa0020 upstream.

The comparison for devnr limits is off-by-one, the current check
allows 0 to AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS and the limit should be in fact
0 to AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS - 1.  This can lead to an out of bounds
write to pdata->dac[devnr]. Fix this by replacing > with >= on the
comparison.
