Subject: ARM: dts: omap3: Fix am3517 mdio and emac clock references

From: Adam Ford <aford173@gmail.com>

commit 0144eb204cdcdf09a76794b4a294291388e739bc upstream.

A previous patch removed OMAP clock aliases that were perceived
to be unnecessary.  Unfortunately, it broke the ethernet on the
am3517-evm.  This patch enables the MDIO clock and EMAC clock.

Fixes: 0ed266d7ae5e ("clk: ti: omap3: cleanup unnecessary clock aliases")
