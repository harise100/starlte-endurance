Subject: HID: quirks: Fix keyboard + touchpad on Toshiba Click Mini not working

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

commit edfc3722cfef4217c7fe92b272cbe0288ba1ff57 upstream.

The Toshiba Click Mini uses an i2c attached keyboard/touchpad combo
(single i2c_hid device for both) which has a vid:pid of 04F3:0401,
which is also used by a bunch of Elan touchpads which are handled by the
drivers/input/mouse/elan_i2c driver, but that driver deals with pure
touchpads and does not work for a combo device such as the one on the
Toshiba Click Mini.

The combo on the Mini has an ACPI id of ELAN0800, which is not claimed
by the elan_i2c driver, so check for that and if it is found do not ignore
the device. This fixes the keyboard/touchpad combo on the Mini not working
(although with the touchpad in mouse emulation mode).
