Subject: regulator: anatop: Set default voltage selector for vddpu

From: Markus Pargmann <mpa@pengutronix.de>

commit fe08be3ec8672ed92b3ed1b85810df9fa0f98931 upstream.

The code reads the default voltage selector from its register. If the
bootloader disables the regulator, the default voltage selector will be
0 which results in faulty behaviour of this regulator driver.

This patch sets a default voltage selector for vddpu if it is not set in
the register.
