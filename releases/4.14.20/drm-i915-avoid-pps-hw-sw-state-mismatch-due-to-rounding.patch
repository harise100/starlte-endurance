Subject: drm/i915: Avoid PPS HW/SW state mismatch due to rounding
MIME-Version: 1.0

From: Imre Deak <imre.deak@intel.com>

commit 5643205c6340b565a3be0fe0e7305dc4aa551c74 upstream.

We store a SW state of the t11_t12 timing in 100usec units but have to
program it in 100msec as required by HW. The rounding used during
programming means there will be a mismatch between the SW and HW states
of this value triggering a "PPS state mismatch" error. Avoid this by
storing the already rounded-up value in the SW state.

Note that we still calculate panel_power_cycle_delay with the finer
100usec granularity to avoid any needless waits using that version of
the delay.
