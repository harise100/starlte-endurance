Subject: IB/qib: fix false-postive maybe-uninitialized warning

From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

commit f6aafac184a3e46e919769dd4faa8bf0dc436534 upstream.

aarch64-linux-gcc-7 complains about code it doesn't fully understand:

drivers/infiniband/hw/qib/qib_iba7322.c: In function 'qib_7322_txchk_change':
include/asm-generic/bitops/non-atomic.h:105:35: error: 'shadow' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The code is right, and despite trying hard, I could not come up with a version
that I liked better than just adding a fake initialization here to shut up the
warning.
