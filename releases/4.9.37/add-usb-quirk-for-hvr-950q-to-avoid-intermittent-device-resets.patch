Subject: Add USB quirk for HVR-950q to avoid intermittent device resets

From: Devin Heitmueller <dheitmueller@kernellabs.com>

commit 6836796de4019944f4ba4c99a360e8250fd2e735 upstream.

The USB core and sysfs will attempt to enumerate certain parameters
which are unsupported by the au0828 - causing inconsistent behavior
and sometimes causing the chip to reset.  Avoid making these calls.

This problem manifested as intermittent cases where the au8522 would
be reset on analog video startup, in particular when starting up ALSA
audio streaming in parallel - the sysfs entries created by
snd-usb-audio on streaming startup would result in unsupported control
messages being sent during tuning which would put the chip into an
unknown state.
