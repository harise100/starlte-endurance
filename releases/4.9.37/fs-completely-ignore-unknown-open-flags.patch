Subject: fs: completely ignore unknown open flags

From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

commit 629e014bb8349fcf7c1e4df19a842652ece1c945 upstream.

Currently we just stash anything we got into file->f_flags, and the
report it in fcntl(F_GETFD).  This patch just clears out all unknown
flags so that we don't pass them to the fs or report them.
