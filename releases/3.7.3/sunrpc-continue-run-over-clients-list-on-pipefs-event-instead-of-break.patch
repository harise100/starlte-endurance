Subject: SUNRPC: continue run over clients list on PipeFS event instead of break

From: Stanislav Kinsbursky <skinsbursky@parallels.com>

commit cd6c5968582a273561464fe6b1e8cc8214be02df upstream.

There are SUNRPC clients, which program doesn't have pipe_dir_name. These
clients can be skipped on PipeFS events, because nothing have to be created or
destroyed. But instead of breaking in case of such a client was found, search
for suitable client over clients list have to be continued. Otherwise some
clients could not be covered by PipeFS event handler.
