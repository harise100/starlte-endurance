Subject: dm: disable WRITE SAME

From: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>

commit c1a94672a830e01d58c7c7e8de530c3f136d6ff2 upstream.

WRITE SAME bios are not yet handled correctly by device-mapper so
disable their use on device-mapper devices by setting
max_write_same_sectors to zero.

As an example, a ciphertext device is incompatible because the data
gets changed according to the location at which it written and so the
dm crypt target cannot support it.
