Subject: nvme-rdma: support devices with queue size < 32

From: Marta Rybczynska <mrybczyn@kalray.eu>

commit 0544f5494a03b8846db74e02be5685d1f32b06c9 upstream.

In the case of small NVMe-oF queue size (<32) we may enter a deadlock
caused by the fact that the IB completions aren't sent waiting for 32
and the send queue will fill up.

The error is seen as (using mlx5):
[ 2048.693355] mlx5_0:mlx5_ib_post_send:3765:(pid 7273):
[ 2048.693360] nvme nvme1: nvme_rdma_post_send failed with error code -12

This patch changes the way the signaling is done so that it depends on
the queue depth now. The magic define has been removed completely.
