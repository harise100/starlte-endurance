Subject: USB: Nokia 502 is an unusual device

From: Mikhail Zolotaryov <lebon@lebon.org.ua>

commit 0e16114f2db4838251fb64f3b550996ad3585890 upstream.

The USB storage operation of Nokia Asha 502 Dual SIM smartphone running Asha
Platform 1.1.1 is unreliable in respect of data consistency (i.e. transfered
files are corrupted). A similar issue is described here:
http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Asha-and-other-Nokia-Series-30/Nokia-301-USB-transfers-and-corrupted-files/td-p/1974170

The workaround is (MAX_SECTORS_64):
   rmmod usb_storage && modprobe usb_storage quirks=0421:06aa:m

The patch adds the tested device to the unusual list permanently.
