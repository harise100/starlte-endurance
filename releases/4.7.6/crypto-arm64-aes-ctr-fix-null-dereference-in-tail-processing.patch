Subject: crypto: arm64/aes-ctr - fix NULL dereference in tail processing

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

commit 2db34e78f126c6001d79d3b66ab1abb482dc7caa upstream.

The AES-CTR glue code avoids calling into the blkcipher API for the
tail portion of the walk, by comparing the remainder of walk.nbytes
modulo AES_BLOCK_SIZE with the residual nbytes, and jumping straight
into the tail processing block if they are equal. This tail processing
block checks whether nbytes != 0, and does nothing otherwise.

However, in case of an allocation failure in the blkcipher layer, we
may enter this code with walk.nbytes == 0, while nbytes > 0. In this
case, we should not dereference the source and destination pointers,
since they may be NULL. So instead of checking for nbytes != 0, check
for (walk.nbytes % AES_BLOCK_SIZE) != 0, which implies the former in
non-error conditions.
