commit 124a3d88fa20e1869fc229d7d8c740cc81944264 upstream.

Newer versions of gcc warn about the use of __builtin_return_address()
with a non-zero argument when "-Wall" is specified:

  kernel/trace/trace_irqsoff.c: In function ‘stop_critical_timings’:
  kernel/trace/trace_irqsoff.c:433:86: warning: calling ‘__builtin_return_address’ with a nonzero argument is unsafe [-Wframe-address]
     stop_critical_timing(CALLER_ADDR0, CALLER_ADDR1);
  [ .. repeats a few times for other similar cases .. ]

It is true that a non-zero argument is somewhat dangerous, and we do not
actually have very many uses of that in the kernel - but the ftrace code
does use it, and as Stephen Rostedt says:

 "We are well aware of the danger of using __builtin_return_address() of
  > 0.  In fact that's part of the reason for having the "thunk" code in
  x86 (See arch/x86/entry/thunk_{64,32}.S).  [..] it adds extra frames
  when tracking irqs off sections, to prevent __builtin_return_address()
  from accessing bad areas.  In fact the thunk_32.S states: 'Trampoline to
  trace irqs off.  (otherwise CALLER_ADDR1 might crash)'."

For now, __builtin_return_address() with a non-zero argument is the best
we can do, and the warning is not helpful and can end up making people
miss other warnings for real problems.

So disable the frame-address warning on compilers that need it.
