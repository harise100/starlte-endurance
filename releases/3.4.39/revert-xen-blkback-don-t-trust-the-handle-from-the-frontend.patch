Subject: Revert "xen/blkback: Don't trust the handle from the frontend."

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

This reverts commit c93c85196e2c7001daa8a04b83a9d6dd4febfb59 which is
commit 01c681d4c70d64cb72142a2823f27c4146a02e63 upstream.

It shouldn't have been applied to the 3.4-stable tree, sorry about that.
