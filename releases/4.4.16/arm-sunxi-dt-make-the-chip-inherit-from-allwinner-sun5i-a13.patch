Subject: ARM: sunxi/dt: make the CHIP inherit from allwinner,sun5i-a13

From: Boris Brezillon <boris.brezillon@free-electrons.com>

commit 5fc39d347267bd029fcc9099c70e2fe2d53130e9 upstream.

The sun4i-timer driver registers its sched_clock only if the machine is
compatible with "allwinner,sun5i-a13", "allwinner,sun5i-a10s" or
"allwinner,sun4i-a10".
Add the missing "allwinner,sun5i-a13" string to the machine compatible.
