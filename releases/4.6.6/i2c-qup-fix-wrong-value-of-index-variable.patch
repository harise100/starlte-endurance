Subject: i2c: qup: Fix wrong value of index variable

From: Sricharan R <sricharan@codeaurora.org>

commit d4f56c7773483b8829e89cfc739b7a5a071f6da0 upstream.

index gets incremented during check to determine if the
messages can be transferred with dma. But not reset after
that, resulting in wrong start value in subsequent loop,
causing failure. Fix it.
