Subject: hwmon: (w83781d) Fix W83782D support (NULL pointer dereference)
To: stable@kernel.org

Commit 848ddf116b3d1711c956fac8627be12dfe8d736f upstream

Commit 360782dde00a2e6e7d9fd57535f90934707ab8a8 (hwmon: (w83781d) Stop
abusing struct i2c_client for ISA devices) broke W83782D support for
devices connected on the ISA bus. You will hit a NULL pointer
dereference as soon as you read any device attribute. Other devices,
and W83782D devices on the SMBus, aren't affected.
