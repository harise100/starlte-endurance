Subject: ipc/sem.c: fix complex_count vs. simple op race

From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>

commit 5864a2fd3088db73d47942370d0f7210a807b9bc upstream.

Commit 6d07b68ce16a ("ipc/sem.c: optimize sem_lock()") introduced a
race:

sem_lock has a fast path that allows parallel simple operations.
There are two reasons why a simple operation cannot run in parallel:
 - a non-simple operations is ongoing (sma->sem_perm.lock held)
 - a complex operation is sleeping (sma->complex_count != 0)

As both facts are stored independently, a thread can bypass the current
checks by sleeping in the right positions.  See below for more details
(or kernel bugzilla 105651).

The patch fixes that by creating one variable (complex_mode)
that tracks both reasons why parallel operations are not possible.

The patch also updates stale documentation regarding the locking.

With regards to stable kernels:
The patch is required for all kernels that include the
commit 6d07b68ce16a ("ipc/sem.c: optimize sem_lock()") (3.10?)

The alternative is to revert the patch that introduced the race.

The patch is safe for backporting, i.e. it makes no assumptions
about memory barriers in spin_unlock_wait().

Background:
Here is the race of the current implementation:

Thread A: (simple op)
- does the first "sma->complex_count == 0" test

Thread B: (complex op)
- does sem_lock(): This includes an array scan. But the scan can't
  find Thread A, because Thread A does not own sem->lock yet.
- the thread does the operation, increases complex_count,
  drops sem_lock, sleeps

Thread A:
- spin_lock(&sem->lock), spin_is_locked(sma->sem_perm.lock)
- sleeps before the complex_count test

Thread C: (complex op)
- does sem_lock (no array scan, complex_count==1)
- wakes up Thread B.
- decrements complex_count

Thread A:
- does the complex_count test

Bug:
Now both thread A and thread C operate on the same array, without
any synchronization.
