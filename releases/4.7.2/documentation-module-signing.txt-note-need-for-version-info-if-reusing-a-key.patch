Subject: Documentation/module-signing.txt: Note need for version info if reusing a key

From: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>

commit b8612e517c3c9809e1200b72c474dbfd969e5a83 upstream.

Signing a module should only make it trusted by the specific kernel it
was built for, not anything else.  If a module signing key is used for
multiple ABI-incompatible kernels, the modules need to include enough
version information to distinguish them.
