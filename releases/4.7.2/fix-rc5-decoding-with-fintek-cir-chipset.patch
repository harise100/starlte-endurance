commit bbdb34c90aeb8b2253eae88029788ebe1d7f2fd4 upstream.

Fix RC5 decoding with Fintek CIR chipset

Commit e87b540be2dd02552fb9244d50ae8b4e4619a34b tightened up the RC5
decoding by adding a check for trailing silence to ensure a valid RC5
command had been received. Unfortunately the trailer length checked was
10 units and the Fintek CIR device does not want to provide details of a
space longer than 6350us. This meant that RC5 remotes working on a
Fintek setup on 3.16 failed on 3.17 and later. Fix this by shortening
the trailer check to 6 units (allowing for a previous space in the
received remote command).
