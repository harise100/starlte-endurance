Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: fixes the gic400 2nd region size for rk3368

From: Caesar Wang <wxt@rock-chips.com>

commit ad1cfdf518976447e6b0d31517bad4e3ebbce6bb upstream.

The 2nd additional region is the GIC virtual cpu interface register
base and size.

As the gic400 of rk3368 says, the cpu interface register map as below

:

-0x0000 GICC_CTRL
.
.
.
-0x00fc GICC_IIDR
-0x1000 GICC_IDR

Obviously, the region size should be greater than 0x1000.
So we should make sure to include the GICC_IDR since the kernel will access
it in some cases.
