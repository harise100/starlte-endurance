Subject: Fix BeFS slab corruption

From: Diego Calleja <diegocg@gmail.com>

In bugzilla #6941, Jens Kilian reported:

"The function befs_utf2nls (in fs/befs/linuxvfs.c) writes a 0 byte past the
end of a block of memory allocated via kmalloc(), leading to memory
corruption.  This happens only for filenames which are pure ASCII and a
multiple of 4 bytes in length.  [...]

Without DEBUG_SLAB, this leads to further corruption and hard lockups; I
believe this is the bug which has made kernels later than 2.6.8 unusable
for me.  (This must be due to changes in memory management, the bug has
been in the BeFS driver since the time it was introduced (AFAICT).)

Steps to reproduce:
Create a directory (in BeOS, naturally :-) with files named, e.g.,
"1", "22", "333", "4444", ...  Mount it in Linux and do an "ls" or "find""

This patch implements the suggested fix. Credits to Jens Kilian for
debugging the problem and finding the right fix.
