Subject: tty/serial: atmel: use port->name as name in request_irq()

From: Sebastian Andrzej Siewior <bigeasy@linutronix.de>

commit 9594b5be7ec110ed11acec58fa94f3f293668c85 upstream.

I was puzzled while looking at /proc/interrupts and random things showed
up between reboots. This occurred more often but I realised it later. The
"correct" output should be:
|38:      11861  atmel-aic5   2 Level     ttyS0

but I saw sometimes
|38:       6426  atmel-aic5   2 Level     tty1

and accounted it wrongly as correct. This is use after free and the
former example randomly got the "old" pointer which pointed to the same
content. With SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM and HARDENED I even got
|38:       7067  atmel-aic5   2 Level     E=Started User Manager for UID 0

or other nonsense.
As it turns out the tty, pointer that is accessed in atmel_startup(), is
freed() before atmel_shutdown(). It seems to happen quite often that the
tty for ttyS0 is allocated and freed while ->shutdown is not invoked. I
don't do anything special - just a systemd boot :)

Use dev_name(&pdev->dev) as the IRQ name for request_irq(). This exists
as long as the driver is loaded so no use-after-free here.
