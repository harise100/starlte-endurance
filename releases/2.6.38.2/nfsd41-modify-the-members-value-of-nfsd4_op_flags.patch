Subject: nfsd41: modify the members value of nfsd4_op_flags

From: Mi Jinlong <mijinlong@cn.fujitsu.com>

commit 5ece3cafbd88d4da5c734e1810c4a2e6474b57b2 upstream.

The members of nfsd4_op_flags, (ALLOWED_WITHOUT_FH | ALLOWED_ON_ABSENT_FS)
equals to  ALLOWED_AS_FIRST_OP, maybe that's not what we want.

OP_PUTROOTFH with op_flags = ALLOWED_WITHOUT_FH | ALLOWED_ON_ABSENT_FS,
can't appears as the first operation with out SEQUENCE ops.

This patch modify the wrong value of ALLOWED_WITHOUT_FH etc which
was introduced by f9bb94c4.
