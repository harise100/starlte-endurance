Subject: virtio_balloon: init 1st buffer in stats vq

From: Ladi Prosek <lprosek@redhat.com>

commit fc8653228c8588a120f6b5dad6983b7b61ff669e upstream.

When init_vqs runs, virtio_balloon.stats is either uninitialized or
contains stale values. The host updates its state with garbage data
because it has no way of knowing that this is just a marker buffer
used for signaling.

This patch updates the stats before pushing the initial buffer.

Alternative fixes:
* Push an empty buffer in init_vqs. Not easily done with the current
  virtio implementation and violates the spec "Driver MUST supply the
  same subset of statistics in all buffers submitted to the statsq".
* Push a buffer with invalid tags in init_vqs. Violates the same
  spec clause, plus "invalid tag" is not really defined.

Note: the spec says:
	When using the legacy interface, the device SHOULD ignore all values in
	the first buffer in the statsq supplied by the driver after device
	initialization. Note: Historically, drivers supplied an uninitialized
	buffer in the first buffer.

Unfortunately QEMU does not seem to implement the recommendation
even for the legacy interface.
