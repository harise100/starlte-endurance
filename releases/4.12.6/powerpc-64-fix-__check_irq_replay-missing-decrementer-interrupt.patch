Subject: powerpc/64: Fix __check_irq_replay missing decrementer interrupt

From: Nicholas Piggin <npiggin@gmail.com>

commit 3db40c312c2c1eb2187c5731102fa8ff380e6e40 upstream.

If the decrementer wraps again and de-asserts the decrementer
exception while hard-disabled, __check_irq_replay() has a test to
notice the wrap when interrupts are re-enabled.

The decrementer check must be done when clearing the PACA_IRQ_HARD_DIS
flag, not when the PACA_IRQ_DEC flag is tested. Previously this worked
because the decrementer interrupt was always the first one checked
after clearing the hard disable flag, but HMI check was moved ahead of
that, which introduced this bug.

This can cause a missed decrementer interrupt if we soft-disable
interrupts then take an HMI which is recorded in irq_happened, then
hard-disable interrupts for > 4s to wrap the decrementer.
