Subject: ext4: fix overflow caused by missing cast in ext4_resize_fs()

From: Jerry Lee <jerrylee@qnap.com>

commit aec51758ce10a9c847a62a48a168f8c804c6e053 upstream.

On a 32-bit platform, the value of n_blcoks_count may be wrong during
the file system is resized to size larger than 2^32 blocks.  This may
caused the superblock being corrupted with zero blocks count.
