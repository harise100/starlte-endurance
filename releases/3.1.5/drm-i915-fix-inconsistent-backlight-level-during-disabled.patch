Subject: drm/i915: Fix inconsistent backlight level during disabled

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 04b38670cf46c096705f24e92a8747d1ab89e53c upstream.

When the brightness property is inquired while the backlight is disabled,
the driver returns a wrong value (zero) because it probes the value after
the backlight was turned off.  This caused a black screen even after the
backlight is enabled again.  It should return the internal backlight_level
instead, so that it won't be influenced by the backlight-enable state.
