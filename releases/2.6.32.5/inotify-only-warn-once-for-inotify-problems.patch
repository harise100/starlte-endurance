Subject: inotify: only warn once for inotify problems

From: Eric Paris <eparis@redhat.com>

commit 976ae32be45a736acd49215a7e4771ff91f161c3 upstream.

inotify will WARN() if it finds that the idr and the fsnotify internals
somehow got out of sync.  It was only supposed to do this once but due
to this stupid bug it would warn every single time a problem was
detected.
