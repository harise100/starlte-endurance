Subject: mtd: nand: Fix NAND_USE_BOUNCE_BUFFER flag conflict

From: Scott Wood <scottwood@freescale.com>

commit 5f867db63473f32cce1b868e281ebd42a41f8fad upstream.

Commit 66507c7bc8895f0da6b ("mtd: nand: Add support to use nand_base
poi databuf as bounce buffer") added a flag NAND_USE_BOUNCE_BUFFER
using the same bit value as the existing NAND_BUSWIDTH_AUTO.
