Subject: ARM: dts: i.MX35: Fix can support.

From: Denis Carikli <denis@eukrea.com>

commit e053f96b1a00022b4e2c7ceb7ac0229646626507 upstream.

Since commit 3d42a379b6fa5b46058e3302b1802b29f64865bb
("can: flexcan: add 2nd clock to support imx53 and newer")
the can driver requires a dt nodes to have a second clock.
Add them to imx35 to fix probing the flex can driver on the
respective platforms.
