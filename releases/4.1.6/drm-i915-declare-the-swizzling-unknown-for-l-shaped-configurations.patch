Subject: drm/i915: Declare the swizzling unknown for L-shaped configurations

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

commit 5eb3e5a5e11d14f9deb2a4b83555443b69ab9940 upstream.

The old style of memory interleaving swizzled upto the end of the
first even bank of memory, and then used the remainder as unswizzled on
the unpaired bank - i.e. swizzling is not constant for all memory. This
causes problems when we try to migrate memory and so the kernel prevents
migration at all when we detect L-shaped inconsistent swizzling.
However, this issue also extends to userspace who try to manually detile
into memory as the swizzling for an individual page is unknown (it
depends on its physical address only known to the kernel), userspace
cannot correctly swizzle.

Note that this is a new attempt for the previously merged one,
reverted in

    Revert "drm/i915: Declare the swizzling unknown for L-shaped configurations"

This is cc: stable since we need it to fix up troubles with wc cpu
mmaps that userspace recently started to use widely.
