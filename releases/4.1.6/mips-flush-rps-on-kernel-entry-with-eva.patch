Subject: MIPS: Flush RPS on kernel entry with EVA

From: James Hogan <james.hogan@imgtec.com>

commit 3aff47c062b944a5e1f9af56a37a23f5295628fc upstream.

When EVA is enabled, flush the Return Prediction Stack (RPS) present on
some MIPS cores on entry to the kernel from user mode.

This is important specifically for interAptiv with EVA enabled,
otherwise kernel mode RPS mispredicts may trigger speculative fetches of
user return addresses, which may be sensitive in the kernel address
space due to EVA's overlapping user/kernel address spaces.
