Subject: PCI hotplug: cpqphp: fix kernel NULL pointer dereference
To: jejb@kernel.org, stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <200810240250.m9O2o3aV015117@hera.kernel.org>

commit d2174c3c07adad88dd9ba37a731e0b00b746822a upstream

The following patch fixes the regression in 2.6.27 that causes kernel
NULL pointer dereference at cpqphp driver probe time.  This patch should
be backported to the .27 stable series.

Seems to have been introduced by
f46753c5e354b857b20ab8e0fe7b2579831dc369.

The root cause of this problem seems that cpqphp driver calls
pci_hp_register() wrongly. In current implementation, cpqphp driver
passes 'ctrl->pci_dev->subordinate' as a second parameter for
pci_hp_register(). But because hotplug slots and it's hotplug controller
(exists as a pci funcion) are on the same bus, it should be
'ctrl->pci_dev->bus' instead.
