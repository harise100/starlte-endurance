Subject: btrfs: properly track when rescan worker is running

From: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>

commit d2c609b834d62f1e91f1635a27dca29f7806d3d6 upstream.

The qgroup_flags field is overloaded such that it reflects the on-disk
status of qgroups and the runtime state.  The BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN
flag is used to indicate that a rescan operation is in progress, but if
the file system is unmounted while a rescan is running, the rescan
operation is paused.  If the file system is then mounted read-only,
the flag will still be present but the rescan operation will not have
been resumed.  When we go to umount, btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion
will see the flag and interpret it to mean that the rescan worker is
still running and will wait for a completion that will never come.

This patch uses a separate flag to indicate when the worker is
running.  The locking and state surrounding the qgroup rescan worker
needs a lot of attention beyond this patch but this is enough to
avoid a hung umount.
