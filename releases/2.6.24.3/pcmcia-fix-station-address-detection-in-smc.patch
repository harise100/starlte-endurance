Fix station address detection in smc

Megahertz EM1144 PCMCIA ethernet adapter needs special handling
because it has two VERS_1 tuples and the station address is in
the second one. Conversion to generic handling of these fields
broke it. Reverting that fixes the device.

Thanks go to Jon Stanley for not giving up on this one until the
problem was found.
