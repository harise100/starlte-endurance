Subject: NFS: Fix a potential file corruption issue when writing
To: stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <1202497262.8383.8.camel@heimdal.trondhjem.org>

From: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>

patch 5d47a35600270e7115061cb1320ee60ae9bcb6b8 in mainline.

If the inode is flagged as having an invalid mapping, then we can't rely on
the PageUptodate() flag. Ensure that we don't use the "anti-fragmentation"
write optimisation in nfs_updatepage(), since that will cause NFS to write
out areas of the page that are no longer guaranteed to be up to date.

A potential corruption could occur in the following scenario:

client 1			client 2
===============			===============
				fd=open("f",O_CREAT|O_WRONLY,0644);
				write(fd,"fubar\n",6);	// cache last page
				close(fd);
fd=open("f",O_WRONLY|O_APPEND);
write(fd,"foo\n",4);
close(fd);

				fd=open("f",O_WRONLY|O_APPEND);
				write(fd,"bar\n",4);
				close(fd);
-----
The bug may lead to the file "f" reading 'fubar\n\0\0\0\nbar\n' because
client 2 does not update the cached page after re-opening the file for
write. Instead it keeps it marked as PageUptodate() until someone calls
invalidate_inode_pages2() (typically by calling read()).

The bug was introduced by commit 44b11874ff583b6e766a05856b04f3c492c32b84
"NFS: Separate metadata and page cache revalidation mechanisms"
