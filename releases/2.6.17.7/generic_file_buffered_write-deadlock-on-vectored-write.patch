Subject: generic_file_buffered_write(): deadlock on vectored write

From: "Vladimir V. Saveliev" <vs@namesys.com>

generic_file_buffered_write() prefaults in user pages in order to avoid
deadlock on copying from the same page as write goes to.

However, it looks like there is a problem when write is vectored:
fault_in_pages_readable brings in current segment or its part (maxlen). 
OTOH, filemap_copy_from_user_iovec is called to copy number of bytes
(bytes) which may exceed current segment, so filemap_copy_from_user_iovec
switches to the next segment which is not brought in yet.  Pagefault is
generated.  That causes the deadlock if pagefault is for the same page
write goes to: page being written is locked and not uptodate, pagefault
will deadlock trying to lock locked page.

[akpm@osdl.org: somewhat rewritten]
