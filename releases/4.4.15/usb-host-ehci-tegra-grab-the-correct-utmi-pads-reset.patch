Subject: usb: host: ehci-tegra: Grab the correct UTMI pads reset

From: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

commit f8a15a9650694feaa0dabf197b0c94d37cd3fb42 upstream.

There are three EHCI controllers on Tegra SoCs, each with its own reset
line. However, the first controller contains a set of UTMI configuration
registers that are shared with its siblings. These registers will only
be reset as part of the first controller's reset. For proper operation
it must be ensured that the UTMI configuration registers are reset
before any of the EHCI controllers are enabled, irrespective of the
probe order.

Commit a47cc24cd1e5 ("USB: EHCI: tegra: Fix probe order issue leading to
broken USB") introduced code that ensures the first controller is always
reset before setting up any of the controllers, and is never again reset
afterwards.

This code, however, grabs the wrong reset. Each EHCI controller has two
reset controls attached: 1) the USB controller reset and 2) the UTMI
pads reset (really the first controller's reset). In order to reset the
UTMI pads registers the code must grab the second reset, but instead it
grabbing the first.
