Subject: usb: quirks: Add no-lpm quirk for Acer C120 LED Projector

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

commit 32cb0b37098f4beeff5ad9e325f11b42a6ede56c upstream.

The Acer C120 LED Projector is a USB-3 connected pico projector which
takes both its power and video data from USB-3.

In combination with some hubs this device does not play well with
lpm, so disable lpm for it.
