Subject: xhci: Fix an error in count_sg_trbs_needed()

From: Paul Zimmerman <Paul.Zimmerman@synopsys.com>

commit bcd2fde05341cef0052e49566ec88b406a521cf3 upstream.

The expression

	while (running_total < sg_dma_len(sg))

does not take into account that the remaining data length can be less
than sg_dma_len(sg). In that case, running_total can end up being
greater than the total data length, so an extra TRB is counted.
Changing the expression to

	while (running_total < sg_dma_len(sg) && running_total < temp)

fixes that.

This patch should be queued for stable kernels back to 2.6.31.
