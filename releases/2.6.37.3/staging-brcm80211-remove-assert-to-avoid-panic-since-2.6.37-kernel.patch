commit d062d44a8386c82c06e483f0c0d1124ba3cab2c8 upstream

The driver assumed it would receive skb packets from MAC80211 which
are not cloned. To guard this assumption an assert was placed in
the transmit routine. As of kernel 2.6.37 it turns out MAC80211 does
pass skb packets that are cloned. The assert is also not needed as
it does not lead to a failure state in our driver when the packet is
cloned. Therefore the assert can safely be removed.
