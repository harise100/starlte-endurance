Subject: powerpc: Fix DSCR inheritance in copy_thread()

From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>

commit 1021cb268b3025573c4811f1dee4a11260c4507b upstream.

If the default DSCR is non zero we set thread.dscr_inherit in
copy_thread() meaning the new thread and all its children will ignore
future updates to the default DSCR. This is not intended and is
a change in behaviour that a number of our users have hit.

We just need to inherit thread.dscr and thread.dscr_inherit from
the parent which ends up being much simpler.

This was found with the following test case:
