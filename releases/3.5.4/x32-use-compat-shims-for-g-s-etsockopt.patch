Subject: x32: Use compat shims for {g,s}etsockopt

From: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

commit 515c7af85ed92696c311c53d53cb4898ff32d784 upstream.

Some of the arguments to {g,s}etsockopt are passed in userland pointers.
If we try to use the 64bit entry point, we end up sometimes failing.

For example, dhcpcd doesn't run in x32:
	# dhcpcd eth0
	dhcpcd[1979]: version 5.5.6 starting
	dhcpcd[1979]: eth0: broadcasting for a lease
	dhcpcd[1979]: eth0: open_socket: Invalid argument
	dhcpcd[1979]: eth0: send_raw_packet: Bad file descriptor

The code in particular is getting back EINVAL when doing:
	struct sock_fprog pf;
	setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, &pf, sizeof(pf));

Diving into the kernel code, we can see:
include/linux/filter.h:
	struct sock_fprog {
		unsigned short len;
		struct sock_filter __user *filter;
	};

net/core/sock.c:
	case SO_ATTACH_FILTER:
		ret = -EINVAL;
		if (optlen == sizeof(struct sock_fprog)) {
			struct sock_fprog fprog;

			ret = -EFAULT;
			if (copy_from_user(&fprog, optval, sizeof(fprog)))
				break;

			ret = sk_attach_filter(&fprog, sk);
		}
		break;

arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl:
	54 common setsockopt sys_setsockopt
	55 common getsockopt sys_getsockopt

So for x64, sizeof(sock_fprog) is 16 bytes.  For x86/x32, it's 8 bytes.
This comes down to the pointer being 32bit for x32, which means we need
to do structure size translation.  But since x32 comes in directly to
sys_setsockopt, it doesn't get translated like x86.

After changing the syscall table and rebuilding glibc with the new kernel
headers, dhcp runs fine in an x32 userland.

Oddly, it seems like Linus noted the same thing during the initial port,
but I guess that was missed/lost along the way:

[ hpa: tagging for -stable since this is an ABI fix. ]
