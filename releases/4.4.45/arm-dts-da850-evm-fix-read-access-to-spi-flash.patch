Subject: ARM: dts: da850-evm: fix read access to SPI flash

From: Fabien Parent <fparent@baylibre.com>

commit 43849785e1079f6606a31cb7fda92d1200849728 upstream.

Read access to the SPI flash are broken on da850-evm, i.e. the data
read is not what is actually programmed on the flash.
According to the datasheet for the M25P64 part present on the da850-evm,
if the SPI frequency is higher than 20MHz then the READ command is not
usable anymore and only the FAST_READ command can be used to read data.

This commit specifies in the DTS that we should use FAST_READ command
instead of the READ command.
