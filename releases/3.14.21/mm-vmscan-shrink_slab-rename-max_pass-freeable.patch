Subject: mm: vmscan: shrink_slab: rename max_pass -> freeable

From: Vladimir Davydov <vdavydov@parallels.com>

commit d5bc5fd3fcb7b8dfb431694a8c8052466504c10c upstream.

The name `max_pass' is misleading, because this variable actually keeps
the estimate number of freeable objects, not the maximal number of
objects we can scan in this pass, which can be twice that.  Rename it to
reflect its actual meaning.
