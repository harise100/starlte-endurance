Subject: ACPI: Fix regression where _PPC is not read at boot even when ignore_ppc=0

From: Darrick J. Wong <djwong@us.ibm.com>

commit 455c0d71d46e86b0b7ff2c9dcfc19bc162302ee9 upstream.

Earlier, Ingo Molnar posted a patch to make it so that the kernel would avoid
reading _PPC on his broken T60.  Unfortunately, it seems that with Thomas
Renninger's patch last July to eliminate _PPC evaluations when the processor
driver loads, the kernel never actually reads _PPC at all!  This is problematic
if you happen to boot your non-T60 computer in a state where the BIOS _wants_
_PPC to be something other than zero.

So, put the _PPC evaluation back into acpi_processor_get_performance_info if
ignore_ppc isn't 1.
