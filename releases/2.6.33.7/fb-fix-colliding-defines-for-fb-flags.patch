Subject: fb: fix colliding defines for fb flags.

From: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>

commit b26c949755c06ec79e55a75817210083bd78fc9a upstream.

When I added the flags I must have been using a 25 line terminal and missed the following flags.

The collided with flag has one user in staging despite being in-tree for 5 years.

I'm happy to push this via my drm tree unless someone really wants to do it.
