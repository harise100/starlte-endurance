Subject: mac80211: fix supported rates IE if AP doesn't give us it's rates

From: Stanislaw Gruszka <sgruszka@redhat.com>

commit 76f273640134f3eb8257179cd5b3bc6ba5fe4a96 upstream.

If AP do not provide us supported rates before assiociation, send
all rates we are supporting instead of empty information element.

v1 -> v2: Add comment.
