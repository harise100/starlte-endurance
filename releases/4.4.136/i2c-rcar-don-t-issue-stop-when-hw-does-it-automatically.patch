Subject: i2c: rcar: don't issue stop when HW does it automatically

From: Wolfram Sang <wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>

commit d89667b14f9d13b684287f6189ca209af5feee43 upstream.

The manual says (55.4.8.6) that HW does automatically send STOP after
NACK was received. My measuerments confirm that.
