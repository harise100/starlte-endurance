Subject: nvme: add quirk to force medium priority for SQ creation

From: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>

commit 9abd68ef454c824bfd18629033367b4382b5f390 upstream.

Some P3100 drives have a bug where they think WRRU (weighted round robin)
is always enabled, even though the host doesn't set it. Since they think
it's enabled, they also look at the submission queue creation priority. We
used to set that to MEDIUM by default, but that was removed in commit
81c1cd98351b. This causes various issues on that drive. Add a quirk to
still set MEDIUM priority for that controller.

Fixes: 81c1cd98351b ("nvme/pci: Don't set reserved SQ create flags")
