Subject: r8169: fix powering up RTL8168h

From: Heiner Kallweit <hkallweit1@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 3148dedfe79e422f448a10250d3e2cdf8b7ee617 ]

Since commit a92a08499b1f "r8169: improve runtime pm in general and
suspend unused ports" interfaces w/o link are runtime-suspended after
10s. On systems where drivers take longer to load this can lead to the
situation that the interface is runtime-suspended already when it's
initially brought up.
This shouldn't be a problem because rtl_open() resumes MAC/PHY.
However with at least one chip version the interface doesn't properly
come up, as reported here:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199549

The vendor driver uses a delay to give certain chip versions some
time to resume before starting the PHY configuration. So let's do
the same. I don't know which chip versions may be affected,
therefore apply this delay always.

This patch was reported to fix the issue for RTL8168h.
I was able to reproduce the issue on an Asus H310I-Plus which also
uses a RTL8168h. Also in my case the patch fixed the issue.
