Subject: serial8250: sanity check nr_uarts on all paths.
To: jejb@kernel.org, stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <200807122140.m6CLeWMT009319@hera.kernel.org>

From: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>

commit 05d81d2222beec7b63ac8c1c8cdb5bb4f82c2bad upstream

I had 8250.nr_uarts=16 in the boot line of a test kernel and I had a weird
mysterious crash in sysfs.  After taking an in-depth look I realized that
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_NR_UARTS was set to 4 and I was walking off the end of
the serial8250_ports array.

Ouch!!!

Don't let this happen to someone else.
