Subject: i2c-algo-bit: Fix timeout test
To: stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <20090507145724.730d8916@hyperion.delvare>


From: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>

commit 0cdba07bb23cdd3e0d64357ec3d983e6b75e541f upstream

When fetching DDC using i2c algo bit, we were often seeing timeouts
before getting valid EDID on a retry. The VESA spec states 2ms is the
DDC timeout, so when this translates into 1 jiffie and we are close
to the end of the time period, it could return with a timeout less than
2ms.

Change this code to use time_after instead of time_after_eq.
