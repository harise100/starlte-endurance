commit 56a76f8275c379ed73c8a43cfa1dfa2f5e9cfa19 upstream


fs: fix page_mkwrite error cases in core code and btrfs

page_mkwrite is called with neither the page lock nor the ptl held.  This
means a page can be concurrently truncated or invalidated out from
underneath it.  Callers are supposed to prevent truncate races themselves,
however previously the only thing they can do in case they hit one is to
raise a SIGBUS.  A sigbus is wrong for the case that the page has been
invalidated or truncated within i_size (eg.  hole punched).  Callers may
also have to perform memory allocations in this path, where again, SIGBUS
would be wrong.

The previous patch ("mm: page_mkwrite change prototype to match fault")
made it possible to properly specify errors.  Convert the generic buffer.c
code and btrfs to return sane error values (in the case of page removed
from pagecache, VM_FAULT_NOPAGE will cause the fault handler to exit
without doing anything, and the fault will be retried properly).

This fixes core code, and converts btrfs as a template/example.  All other
filesystems defining their own page_mkwrite should be fixed in a similar
manner.
