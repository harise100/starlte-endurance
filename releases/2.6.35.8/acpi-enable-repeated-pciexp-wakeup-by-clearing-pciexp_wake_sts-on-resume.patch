Subject: ACPI: enable repeated PCIEXP wakeup by clearing PCIEXP_WAKE_STS on resume

From: Colin Ian King <colin.king@canonical.com>

commit 573b638158029898caf9470c8214b7ddd29751e3 upstream.

Section 4.7.3.1.1 (PM1 Status Registers) of version 4.0 of
the ACPI spec concerning PCIEXP_WAKE_STS points out in
in the final note field in table 4-11 that if this bit is
set to 1 and the system is put into a sleeping state then
the system will not automatically wake.

This bit gets set by hardware to indicate that the system
woke up due to a PCI Express wakeup event, so clear it during
acpi_hw_clear_acpi_status() calls to enable subsequent
resumes to work.
