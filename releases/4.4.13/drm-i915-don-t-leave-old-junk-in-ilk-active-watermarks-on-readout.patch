Subject: drm/i915: Don't leave old junk in ilk active watermarks on readout

commit 7045c3689f148a0c95f42bae8ef3eb2829ac7de9 upstream.

When we read out the watermark state from the hardware we're supposed to
transfer that into the active watermarks, but currently we fail to any
part of the active watermarks that isn't explicitly written. Let's clear
it all upfront.

Looks like this has been like this since the beginning, when I added the
readout. No idea why I didn't clear it up.
