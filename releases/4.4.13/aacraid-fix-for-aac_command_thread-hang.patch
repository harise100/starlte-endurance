Subject: aacraid: Fix for aac_command_thread hang

From: Raghava Aditya Renukunta <RaghavaAditya.Renukunta@microsemi.com>

commit fc4bf75ea300a5e62a2419f89dd0e22189dd7ab7 upstream.

Typically under error conditions, it is possible for aac_command_thread()
to miss the wakeup from kthread_stop() and go back to sleep, causing it
to hang aac_shutdown.

In the observed scenario, the adapter is not functioning correctly and so
aac_fib_send() never completes (or time-outs depending on how it was
called). Shortly after aac_command_thread() starts it performs
aac_fib_send(SendHostTime) which hangs. When aac_probe_one
/aac_get_adapter_info send time outs, kthread_stop is called which breaks
the command thread out of it's hang.

The code will still go back to sleep in schedule_timeout() without
checking kthread_should_stop() so it causes aac_probe_one to hang until
the schedule_timeout() which is 30 minutes.

Fixed by: Adding another kthread_should_stop() before schedule_timeout()
