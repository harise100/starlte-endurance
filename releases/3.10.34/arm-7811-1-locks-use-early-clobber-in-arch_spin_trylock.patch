Subject: ARM: 7811/1: locks: use early clobber in arch_spin_trylock

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

commit afa31d8eb86fc2f25083e675d57ac8173a98f999 upstream.

The res variable is written before we've finished with the input
operands (namely the lock address), so ensure that we mark it as `early
clobber' to avoid unintended register sharing.
