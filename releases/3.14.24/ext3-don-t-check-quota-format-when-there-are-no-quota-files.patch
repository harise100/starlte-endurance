Subject: ext3: Don't check quota format when there are no quota files

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit 7938db449bbc55bbeb164bec7af406212e7e98f1 upstream.

The check whether quota format is set even though there are no
quota files with journalled quota is pointless and it actually
makes it impossible to turn off journalled quotas (as there's
no way to unset journalled quota format). Just remove the check.
