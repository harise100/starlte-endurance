Subject: virtio-net: fix leaking page for gso packet during mergeable XDP

From: Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit 3d62b2a0db505bbf9ed0755f254e45d775f9807f ]

We need to drop refcnt to xdp_page if we see a gso packet. Otherwise
it will be leaked. Fixing this by moving the check of gso packet above
the linearizing logic. While at it, remove useless comment as well.
