Subject: Input: elan_i2c - check if device is there before really probing

From: Dmitry Torokhov <dmitry.torokhov@gmail.com>


[ Upstream commit c5928551fd41b2eecdad78fa2be2a4a13ed5fde9 ]

Before trying to properly initialize the touchpad and generate bunch of
errors, let's first see it there is anything at the given address. If we
get error, fail silently with -ENXIO.
