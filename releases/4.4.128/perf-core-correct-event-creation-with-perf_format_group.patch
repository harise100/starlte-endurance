Subject: perf/core: Correct event creation with PERF_FORMAT_GROUP

From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>


[ Upstream commit ba5213ae6b88fb170c4771fef6553f759c7d8cdd ]

Andi was asking about PERF_FORMAT_GROUP vs inherited events, which led
to the discovery of a bug from commit:

  3dab77fb1bf8 ("perf: Rework/fix the whole read vs group stuff")

 -       PERF_SAMPLE_GROUP                       = 1U << 4,
 +       PERF_SAMPLE_READ                        = 1U << 4,

 -       if (attr->inherit && (attr->sample_type & PERF_SAMPLE_GROUP))
 +       if (attr->inherit && (attr->read_format & PERF_FORMAT_GROUP))

is a clear fail :/

While this changes user visible behaviour; it was previously possible
to create an inherited event with PERF_SAMPLE_READ; this is deemed
acceptible because its results were always incorrect.
