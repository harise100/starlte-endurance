Subject: VFS: Fix automount for negative autofs dentries
To: stable@vger.kernel.org
Cc: gregkh@suse.de, dhowells@redhat.com, raven@themaw.net, viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk
Message-ID: <1319543988-12968-2-git-send-email-miklos@szeredi.hu>

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

commit 5a30d8a2b8ddd5102c440c7e5a7c8e1fd729c818 upstream.
[ backport for 3.0.x: LOOKUP_PARENT => LOOKUP_CONTINUE by Chuck Ebbert
<cebbert@redhat.com> ]

Autofs may set the DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT flag on negative dentries.  These
need attention from the automounter daemon regardless of the LOOKUP_FOLLOW flag.
