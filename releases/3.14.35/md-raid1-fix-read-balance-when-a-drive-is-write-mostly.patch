commit d1901ef099c38afd11add4cfb3312c02ef21ec4a upstream.

When a drive is marked write-mostly it should only be the
target of reads if there is no other option.

This behaviour was broken by

commit 9dedf60313fa4dddfd5b9b226a0ef12a512bf9dc
    md/raid1: read balance chooses idlest disk for SSD

which causes a write-mostly device to be *preferred* is some cases.

Restore correct behaviour by checking and setting
best_dist_disk and best_pending_disk rather than best_disk.

We only need to test one of these as they are both changed
from -1 or >=0 at the same time.

As we leave min_pending and best_dist unchanged, any non-write-mostly
device will appear better than the write-mostly device.
