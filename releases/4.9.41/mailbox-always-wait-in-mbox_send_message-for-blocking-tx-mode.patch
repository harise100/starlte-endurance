Subject: mailbox: always wait in mbox_send_message for blocking Tx mode

From: Sudeep Holla <sudeep.holla@arm.com>

commit c61b781ee084e69855477d23dd33e7e6caad652c upstream.

There exists a race when msg_submit return immediately as there was an
active request being processed which may have completed just before it's
checked again in mbox_send_message. This will result in return to the
caller without waiting in mbox_send_message even when it's blocking Tx.

This patch fixes the issue by waiting for the completion always if Tx
is in blocking mode.

Fixes: 2b6d83e2b8b7 ("mailbox: Introduce framework for mailbox")
