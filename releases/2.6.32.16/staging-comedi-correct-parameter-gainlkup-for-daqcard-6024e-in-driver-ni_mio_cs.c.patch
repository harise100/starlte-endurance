Subject: Staging: comedi - correct parameter gainlkup for DAQCard-6024E in driver ni_mio_cs.c

From: Martin Homuth-Rosemann <homuth-rosemann@gmx.net>

commit ebe8622342f12bed387f7de4b5fb7c52005ccb29 upstream.

Correct at least one of the incorrect specs for a national instrument
data acquisition card DAQCard-6024E. This card has only four different
gain settings (+-10V, +-5V, +-0.5V, +-0.05V).
