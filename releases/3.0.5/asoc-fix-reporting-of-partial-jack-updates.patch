Subject: ASoC: Fix reporting of partial jack updates

From: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

commit 747da0f80e566500421bd7760b2e050fea3fde5e upstream.

We need to report the entire jack state to the core jack code, not just
the bits that were being updated by the caller, otherwise the status
reported by other detection methods will be omitted from the state seen
by userspace.
