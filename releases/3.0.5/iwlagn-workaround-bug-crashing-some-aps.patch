Subject: iwlagn: workaround bug crashing some APs

From: Don Fry <donald.h.fry@intel.com>

commit 2249b011432ca3dcce112f0f71e0f531b4bb9347 upstream.

This patch reverts commit 9b7688328422b88a7a15dc0dc123ad9ab1a6e22d which
was introduced in 2.6.38-rc1.  It works around a problem where the iwlagn
driver stimulates a bug crashing (requiring power cycle to recover) some
APs under heavy traffic.
