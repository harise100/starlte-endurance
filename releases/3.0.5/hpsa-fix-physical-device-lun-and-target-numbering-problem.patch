Subject: [SCSI] hpsa: fix physical device lun and target numbering problem

From: "Stephen M. Cameron" <scameron@beardog.cce.hp.com>

commit 01350d05539d1c95ef3568d062d864ab76ae7670 upstream.

If a physical device exposed to the OS by hpsa
is replaced (e.g. one hot plug tape drive is replaced
by another, or a tape drive is placed into "OBDR" mode
in which it acts like a CD-ROM device) and a rescan is
initiated, the replaced device will be added to the
SCSI midlayer with target and lun numbers set to -1.
After that, a panic is likely to ensue.  When a physical
device is replaced, the lun and target number should be
preserved.
