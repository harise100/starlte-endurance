Subject: md/linear: avoid corrupting structure while waiting for rcu_free to complete.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 1b6afa17581027218088a18a9ceda600e0ddba7a upstream.

I don't know what I was thinking putting 'rcu' after a dynamically
sized array!  The array could still be in use when we call rcu_free()
(That is the point) so we mustn't corrupt it.
