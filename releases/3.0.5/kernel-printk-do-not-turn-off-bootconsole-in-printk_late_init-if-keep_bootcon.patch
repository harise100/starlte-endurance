Subject: kernel/printk: do not turn off bootconsole in printk_late_init() if keep_bootcon

From: Nishanth Aravamudan <nacc@us.ibm.com>

commit 4c30c6f566c0989ddaee3407da44751e340a63ed upstream.

It seems that 7bf693951a8e ("console: allow to retain boot console via
boot option keep_bootcon") doesn't always achieve what it aims, as when
printk_late_init() runs it unconditionally turns off all boot consoles.
With this patch, I am able to see more messages on the boot console in
KVM guests than I can without, when keep_bootcon is specified.

I think it is appropriate for the relevant -stable trees.  However, it's
more of an annoyance than a serious bug (ideally you don't need to keep
the boot console around as console handover should be working -- I was
encountering a situation where the console handover wasn't working and
not having the boot console available meant I couldn't see why).
