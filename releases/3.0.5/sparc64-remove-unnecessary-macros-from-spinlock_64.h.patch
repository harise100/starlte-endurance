Subject: sparc64: remove unnecessary macros from spinlock_64.h

From: Mikael Pettersson <mikpe@it.uu.se>

commit a0fba3eb059e73fed2d376a901f8117734c12f1f upstream.

The sparc64 spinlock_64.h contains a number of operations defined
first as static inline functions, and then as macros with the same
names and parameters as the functions.  Maybe this was needed at
some point in the past, but now nothing seems to depend on these
macros (checked with a recursive grep looking for ifdefs on these
names).  Other archs don't define these identity-macros.

So this patch deletes these unnecessary macros.

Compile-tested with sparc64_defconfig.
