Subject: tty/serial: at91: fix error handling in atmel_serial_probe()

From: Cyrille Pitchen <cyrille.pitchen@atmel.com>

commit 6fbb9bdf0f3fbe23aeff806489791aa876adaffb upstream.

-EDEFER error wasn't handle properly by atmel_serial_probe().
As an example, when atmel_serial_probe() is called for the first time, we pass
the test_and_set_bit() test to check whether the port has already been
initalized. Then we call atmel_init_port(), which may return -EDEFER, possibly
returned before by clk_get(). Consequently atmel_serial_probe() used to return
this error code WITHOUT clearing the port bit in the "atmel_ports_in_use" mask.
When atmel_serial_probe() was called for the second time, it used to fail on
the test_and_set_bit() function then returning -EBUSY.

When atmel_serial_probe() fails, this patch make it clear the port bit in the
"atmel_ports_in_use" mask, if needed, before returning the error code.
