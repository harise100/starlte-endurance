Subject: rtlwifi: Remove logging statement that is no longer needed

From: Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>

commit aeb2d2a4c0ae1739a6e1782bd8c1c96aee8db4e1 upstream.

In commit e9538cf4f907 ("rtlwifi: Fix error when accessing unmapped memory
in skb"), a printk was included to indicate that the condition had been
reached. There is now enough evidence from other users that the fix is
working. That logging statement can now be removed.
