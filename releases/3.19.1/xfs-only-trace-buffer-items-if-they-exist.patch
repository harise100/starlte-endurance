Subject: xfs: only trace buffer items if they exist

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

commit e9892d3cc853afdda2cc69e2576d9ddb5fafad71 upstream.

The commit 2d3d0c5 ("xfs: lobotomise xfs_trans_read_buf_map()") left
a landmine in the tracing code: trace_xfs_trans_buf_read() is now
call on all buffers that are read through this interface rather than
just buffers in transactions. For buffers outside transaction
context, bp->b_fspriv is null, and so the buf log item tracing
functions cannot be called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference
in the trace_xfs_trans_buf_read() function when tracing is turned
on.
