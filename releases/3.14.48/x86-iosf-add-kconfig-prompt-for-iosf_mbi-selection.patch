Subject: x86/iosf: Add Kconfig prompt for IOSF_MBI selection

From: "David E. Box" <david.e.box@linux.intel.com>

commit aa8e4f22ab7773352ba3895597189b8097f2c307 upstream.

Fixes an error in having the iosf build as 'default m'. On X86 SoC's the iosf
sideband is the only way to access information for some registers, as opposed to
through MSR's on other Intel architectures. While selecting IOSF_MBI is
preferred, it does mean carrying extra code on non-SoC architectures. This
exports the selection to the user, allowing those driver writers to compile out
iosf code if it's not being built.
