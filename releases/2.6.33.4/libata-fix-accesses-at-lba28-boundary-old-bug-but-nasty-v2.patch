Subject: libata: Fix accesses at LBA28 boundary (old bug, but nasty) (v2)

From: Mark Lord <kernel@teksavvy.com>

commit 45c4d015a92f72ec47acd0c7557abdc0c8a6499d upstream.

Most drives from Seagate, Hitachi, and possibly other brands,
do not allow LBA28 access to sector number 0x0fffffff (2^28 - 1).
So instead use LBA48 for such accesses.

This bug could bite a lot of systems, especially when the user has
taken care to align partitions to 4KB boundaries. On misaligned systems,
it is less likely to be encountered, since a 4KB read would end at
0x10000000 rather than at 0x0fffffff.
