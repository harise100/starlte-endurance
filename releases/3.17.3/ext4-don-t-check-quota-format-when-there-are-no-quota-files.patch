Subject: ext4: don't check quota format when there are no quota files

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit 279bf6d390933d5353ab298fcc306c391a961469 upstream.

The check whether quota format is set even though there are no
quota files with journalled quota is pointless and it actually
makes it impossible to turn off journalled quotas (as there's
no way to unset journalled quota format). Just remove the check.
