Subject: ext4: fix reservation overflow in ext4_da_write_begin

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

commit 0ff8947fc5f700172b37cbca811a38eb9cb81e08 upstream.

Delalloc write journal reservations only reserve 1 credit,
to update the inode if necessary.  However, it may happen
once in a filesystem's lifetime that a file will cross
the 2G threshold, and require the LARGE_FILE feature to
be set in the superblock as well, if it was not set already.

This overruns the transaction reservation, and can be
demonstrated simply on any ext4 filesystem without the LARGE_FILE
feature already set:

dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1 seek=2147483646 count=1 \
	conv=notrunc of=testfile
sync
dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1 seek=2147483647 count=1 \
	conv=notrunc of=testfile

leads to:

EXT4-fs: ext4_do_update_inode:4296: aborting transaction: error 28 in __ext4_handle_dirty_super
EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_do_update_inode:4301: error 28
EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_reserve_inode_write:4757: Readonly filesystem
EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_dirty_inode:4876: error 28
EXT4-fs error (device loop0) in ext4_da_write_end:2685: error 28

Adjust the number of credits based on whether the flag is
already set, and whether the current write may extend past the
LARGE_FILE limit.
