Subject: KVM: x86: preserve the high 32-bits of the PAT register

From: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>

commit 7cb060a91c0efc5ff94f83c6df3ed705e143cdb9 upstream.

KVM does not really do much with the PAT, so this went unnoticed for a
long time.  It is exposed however if you try to do rdmsr on the PAT
register.
