Subject: intel_pstate: Correct rounding in busy calculation

From: Doug Smythies <doug.smythies@gmail.com>

commit 51d211e9c334b9eca3505f4052afa660c3e0606b upstream.

There was a mistake in the actual rounding portion this previous patch:
f0fe3cd7e12d (intel_pstate: Correct rounding in busy calculation) such that
the rounding was asymetric and incorrect.

Severity: Not very serious, but can increase target pstate by one extra value.
For real world work flows the issue should self correct (but I have no proof).
It is the equivalent of different PID gains for positive and negative numbers.

Examples:
 -3.000000 used to round to -4, rounds to -3 with this patch.
 -3.503906 used to round to -5, rounds to -4 with this patch.

Fixes: f0fe3cd7e12d (intel_pstate: Correct rounding in busy calculation)
