Subject: SCSI: use the scsi data buffer length to extract transfer size

From: "Martin K. Petersen" <martin.petersen@oracle.com>

commit 5616b0a46ed82eb9a093f752fc4d7bd3cc688583 upstream.

Commit 8846bab180fa introduced a helper that can be used to query the
wire transfer size for a SCSI command taking protection information into
account.

However, some commands do not have a 1:1 mapping between the block range
they work on and the payload size (discard, write same). After the
scatterlist has been set up these requests use __data_len to store the
number of bytes to report completion on. This means that callers of
scsi_transfer_length() would get the wrong byte count for these types of
requests.

To overcome this we make scsi_transfer_length() use the scatterlist
length in the scsi_data_buffer as basis for the wire transfer
calculation instead of __data_len.
