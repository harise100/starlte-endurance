Subject: cpufreq: s3c64xx: Rename index to driver_data

From: Charles Keepax <ckeepax@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

commit 0e8244322b7fc45fd11a1c45f70b6bacddf4986f upstream.

The index field of cpufreq_frequency_table has been renamed to
driver_data by commit 5070158 (cpufreq: rename index as driver_data
in cpufreq_frequency_table).

This patch updates the s3c64xx driver to match.
