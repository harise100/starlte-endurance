Subject: [PATCH 61/85] ext4: fix possible recursive locking warning in EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT

(cherry picked from commit 49bd22bc4d603a2a4fc2a6a60e156cbea52eb494)

If CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is enabled, the double_down_write_data_sem()
will trigger a false-positive warning of a recursive lock.  Since we
take i_data_sem for the two inodes ordered by their inode numbers,
this isn't a problem.  Use of down_write_nested() will notify the lock
dependency checker machinery that there is no problem here.

This problem was reported by Brian Rogers:
