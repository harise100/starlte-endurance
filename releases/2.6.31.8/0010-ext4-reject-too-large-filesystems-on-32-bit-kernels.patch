Subject: [PATCH 10/85] ext4: reject too-large filesystems on 32-bit kernels

(cherry picked from commit bf43d84b185e2ff54598f8c58a5a8e63148b6e90)

ext4 will happily mount a > 16T filesystem on a 32-bit box, but
this is not safe; writes to the block device will wrap past 16T
and the page cache can't index past 16T (232 index * 4k pages).

Adding another test to the existing "too many sectors" test
should do the trick.

Add a comment, a relevant return value, and fix the reference
to the CONFIG_LBD(AF) option as well.
