Subject: [PATCH 27/85] ext4: Don't update superblock write time when filesystem is read-only

(cherry picked from commit 71290b368ad5e1e0b0b300c9d5638490a9fd1a2d)

This avoids updating the superblock write time when we are mounting
the root file system read/only but we need to replay the journal; at
that point, for people who are east of GMT and who make their clock
tick in localtime for Windows bug-for-bug compatibility, and this will
cause e2fsck to complain and force a full file system check.
