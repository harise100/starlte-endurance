Subject: [PATCH 79/85] ext4: wait for log to commit when umounting

(cherry picked from commit d4edac314e9ad0b21ba20ba8bc61b61f186f79e1)

There is a potential race when a transaction is committing right when
the file system is being umounting.  This could reduce in a race
because EXT4_SB(sb)->s_group_info could be freed in ext4_put_super
before the commit code calls a callback so the mballoc code can
release freed blocks in the transaction, resulting in a panic trying
to access the freed s_group_info.

The fix is to wait for the transaction to finish committing before we
shutdown the multiblock allocator.
