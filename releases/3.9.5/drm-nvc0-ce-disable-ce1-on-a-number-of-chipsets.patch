Subject: drm/nvc0/ce: disable ce1 on a number of chipsets

From: Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>

commit 6d5f83834dc2b064b8c1202ea281820286b675a8 upstream.

The falcon is present, but the rest of the copy engine doesn't appear to
be...  PUNITS doesn't report disabled (maybe the bits for the copy engines
got added later?), so we end up trying to use a non-functional CE1, and
bust all sorts of things.. Most notably, suspend/resume..
