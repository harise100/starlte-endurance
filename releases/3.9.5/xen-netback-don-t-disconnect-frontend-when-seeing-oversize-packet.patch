Subject: xen-netback: don't disconnect frontend when seeing oversize packet

From: Wei Liu <wei.liu2@citrix.com>

commit 03393fd5cc2b6cdeec32b704ecba64dbb0feae3c upstream.

Some frontend drivers are sending packets > 64 KiB in length. This length
overflows the length field in the first slot making the following slots have
an invalid length.

Turn this error back into a non-fatal error by dropping the packet. To avoid
having the following slots having fatal errors, consume all slots in the
packet.

This does not reopen the security hole in XSA-39 as if the packet as an
invalid number of slots it will still hit fatal error case.
