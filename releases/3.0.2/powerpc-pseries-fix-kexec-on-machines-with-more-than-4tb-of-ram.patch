Subject: powerpc: pseries: Fix kexec on machines with more than 4TB of RAM

From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>

commit bed9a31527af8ff3dfbad62a1a42815cef4baab7 upstream.

On a box with 8TB of RAM the MMU hashtable is 64GB in size. That
means we have 4G PTEs. pSeries_lpar_hptab_clear was using a signed
int to store the index which will overflow at 2G.
