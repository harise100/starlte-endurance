Subject: ACPI: EC: Limit burst to 64 bits

From: Alexey Starikovskiy <astarikovskiy@suse.de>

commit 2060c44576c79086ff24718878d7edaa7384a985 upstream.

access_bit_width field is u8 in ACPICA, thus 256 value written to it
becomes 0, causing divide by zero later.

Proper fix would be to remove access_bit_width at all, just because
we already have access_byte_width, which is access_bit_width / 8.
Limit access width to 64 bit for now.
