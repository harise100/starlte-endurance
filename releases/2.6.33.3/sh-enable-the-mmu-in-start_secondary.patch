Subject: sh: Enable the mmu in start_secondary()

From: Matt Fleming <matt@console-pimps.org>

commit 4bea3418c737891894b9d3d3e9f8bbd67d66fa38 upstream.

For the boot, enable_mmu() is called from setup_arch() but we don't call
setup_arch() for any of the other cpus. So turn on the non-boot cpu's
mmu inside of start_secondary().

I noticed this bug on an SMP board when trying to map I/O memory
(smsc911x registers) into the kernel address space. Since the Address
Translation bit in MMUCR wasn't set, accessing the virtual address where
the smsc911x registers were supposedly mapped actually performed a
physical address access.
