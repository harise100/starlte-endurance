Subject: iio: light: acpi-als: Report data as processed

From: Gabriele Mazzotta <gabriele.mzt@gmail.com>

commit fa34e6dd44d7c02c8a8468ce4a52a7506f907bef upstream.

As per the ACPI specification (Revision 5.0) [1], the data coming
from the sensor represent the ambient light illuminance reading
expressed in lux. So use IIO_CHAN_INFO_PROCESSED to signify that
the data are pre-processed.

However, to keep backward ABI compatibility, the IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW
bit is not removed.

This issue has also been responsible for at least one userspace bug
report hence marking what is a small semantic fix really for stable.
