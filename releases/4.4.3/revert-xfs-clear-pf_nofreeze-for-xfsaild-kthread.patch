Subject: Revert "xfs: clear PF_NOFREEZE for xfsaild kthread"

From: Dave Chinner <david@fromorbit.com>

commit 3e85286e75224fa3f08bdad20e78c8327742634e upstream.

This reverts commit 24ba16bb3d499c49974669cd8429c3e4138ab102 as it
prevents machines from suspending. This regression occurs when the
xfsaild is idle on entry to suspend, and so there s no activity to
wake it from it's idle sleep and hence see that it is supposed to
freeze. Hence the freezer times out waiting for it and suspend is
cancelled.

There is no obvious fix for this short of freezing the filesystem
properly, so revert this change for now.
