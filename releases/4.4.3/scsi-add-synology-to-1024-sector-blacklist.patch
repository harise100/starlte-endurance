Subject: scsi: add Synology to 1024 sector blacklist

From: Mike Christie <mchristi@redhat.com>

commit 9055082fb100cc66e20c048251d05159f5f2cfba upstream.

Another iscsi target that cannot handle large IOs, but does not tell us
a limit.

The Synology iSCSI targets report:

Block limits VPD page (SBC):
  Write same no zero (WSNZ): 0
  Maximum compare and write length: 0 blocks
  Optimal transfer length granularity: 0 blocks
  Maximum transfer length: 0 blocks
  Optimal transfer length: 0 blocks
  Maximum prefetch length: 0 blocks
  Maximum unmap LBA count: 0
  Maximum unmap block descriptor count: 0
  Optimal unmap granularity: 0
  Unmap granularity alignment valid: 0
  Unmap granularity alignment: 0
  Maximum write same length: 0x0 blocks

and the size of the command it can handle seems to depend on how much
memory it can allocate at the time. This results in IO errors when
handling large IOs. This patch just has us use the old 1024 default
sectors for this target by adding it to the scsi blacklist. We do not
have good contacs with this vendors, so I have not been able to try and
fix on their side.

I have posted this a long while back, but it was not merged. This
version just fixes it up for merge/patch failures in the original
version.
