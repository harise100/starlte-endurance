Subject: fs/cifs/cifs_dfs_ref.c: fix potential memory leakage

From: Cong Ding <dinggnu@gmail.com>

commit 10b8c7dff5d3633b69e77f57d404dab54ead3787 upstream.

When it goes to error through line 144, the memory allocated to *devname is
not freed, and the caller doesn't free it either in line 250. So we free the
memroy of *devname in function cifs_compose_mount_options() when it goes to
error.
