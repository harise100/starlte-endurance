Subject: ath10k: fix fetching channel during potential radar detection

From: Mohammed Shafi Shajakhan <mohammed@qti.qualcomm.com>


[ Upstream commit a28f6f27a88f047f03f04b9246ca260ebc91455e ]

Fetch target operating channel during potential radar detection when
the interface is just brought up, but no channel is assigned from
userspace. In this scenario rx_channel may not be having a valid pointer
hence fetch the target operating channel to avoid warnings as below
which can be triggered by the commands with DFS testing over longer run

comamnds:
iw wlan1 set type mesh
ifconfig wlan1 up (valid tgt_oper_chan only)
iw wlan1 cac trigger freq 5260 HT20 (valid rx_channel, tgt_oper_chan)
iw wlan1 cac trigger freq 5280 HT20
iw wlan1 cac trigger freq 5300 HT20

Once the CAC expires, current channel context will be removed and
we are only left with the fallback option of using 'target operating
channel'

Firmware and driver log:
