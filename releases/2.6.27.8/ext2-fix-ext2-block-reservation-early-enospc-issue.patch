Subject: ext2: fix ext2 block reservation early ENOSPC issue

From: Mingming Cao <cmm@us.ibm.com>

commit d707d31c972b657dfc2efefd0b99cc4e14223dab upstream.

We could run into ENOSPC error on ext2, even when there is free blocks on
the filesystem.

The problem is triggered in the case the goal block group has 0 free
blocks , and the rest block groups are skipped due to the check of
"free_blocks < windowsz/2".  Current code could fall back to non
reservation allocation to prevent early ENOSPC after examing all the block
groups with reservation on , but this code was bypassed if the reservation
window is turned off already, which is true in this case.

This patch fixed two issues:
1) We don't need to turn off block reservation if the goal block group has
0 free blocks left and continue search for the rest of block groups.

Current code the intention is to turn off the block reservation if the
goal allocation group has a few (some) free blocks left (not enough for
make the desired reservation window),to try to allocation in the goal
block group, to get better locality.  But if the goal blocks have 0 free
blocks, it should leave the block reservation on, and continues search for
the next block groups,rather than turn off block reservation completely.

2) we don't need to check the window size if the block reservation is off.

The problem was originally found and fixed in ext4.
