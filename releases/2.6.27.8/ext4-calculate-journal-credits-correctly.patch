(cherry picked from commit ac51d83705c2a38c71f39cde99708b14e6212a60)

This fixes a 2.6.27 regression which was introduced in commit a02908f1.

We weren't passing the chunk parameter down to the two subections,
ext4_indirect_trans_blocks() and ext4_ext_index_trans_blocks(), with
the result that massively overestimate the amount of credits needed by
ext4_da_writepages, especially in the non-extents case.  This causes
failures especially on /boot partitions, which tend to be small and
non-extent using since GRUB doesn't handle extents.

This patch fixes the bug reported by Joseph Fannin at:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11964
