Subject: nvme-pci: disable APST for Samsung NVMe SSD 960 EVO + ASUS PRIME Z370-A

From: "Jarosław Janik" <jaroslaw.janik@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 467c77d4cbefaaf65e2f44fe102d543a52fcae5b ]

Yet another "incompatible" Samsung NVMe SSD 960 EVO and Asus motherboard
combination. 960 EVO device disappears from PCIe bus within few minutes
after boot-up when APST is in use and never gets back. Forcing
NVME_QUIRK_NO_APST is the only way to make this drive work with this
particular motherboard. NVME_QUIRK_NO_DEEPEST_PS doesn't work, upgrading
motherboard's BIOS didn't help either.
Since this is a desktop motherboard, the only drawback of not using APST
is increased device temperature.
