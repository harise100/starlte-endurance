Subject: Btrfs: bail out on error during replay_dir_deletes

From: Liu Bo <bo.liu@linux.alibaba.com>

[ Upstream commit b98def7ca6e152ee55e36863dddf6f41f12d1dc6 ]

If errors were returned by btrfs_next_leaf(), replay_dir_deletes needs
to bail out, otherwise @ret would be forced to be 0 after 'break;' and
the caller won't be aware of it.

Fixes: e02119d5a7b4 ("Btrfs: Add a write ahead tree log to optimize synchronous operations")
