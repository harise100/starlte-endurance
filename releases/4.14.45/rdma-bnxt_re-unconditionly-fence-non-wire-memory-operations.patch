Subject: RDMA/bnxt_re: Unconditionly fence non wire memory operations

From: Devesh Sharma <devesh.sharma@broadcom.com>

[ Upstream commit a45bc17b360d75fac9ced85e99fda14bf38b4dc3 ]

HW requires an unconditonal fence for all non-wire memory operations
through SQ. This guarantees the completions of these memory operations.
