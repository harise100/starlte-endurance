Subject: arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rock64 gmac2io stability issues

From: "Kamil Trzciński" <ayufan@ayufan.eu>

[ Upstream commit 73e42e18669934fa96cf2bb54291da54177076d7 ]

This commit enables thresh dma mode as this forces to disable checksuming,
and chooses delay values which make the interface stable.

These changes are needed, because ROCK64 is faced with two problems:
1. tx checksuming does not work with packets larger than 1498,
2. the default delays for tx/rx are not stable when using 1Gbps connection.

Delays were found out with:
