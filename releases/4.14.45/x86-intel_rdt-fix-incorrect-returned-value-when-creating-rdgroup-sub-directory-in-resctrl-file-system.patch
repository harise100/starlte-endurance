Subject: x86/intel_rdt: Fix incorrect returned value when creating rdgroup sub-directory in resctrl file system

From: Wang Hui <john.wanghui@huawei.com>

[ Upstream commit 36e74d355297dde6e69a39c838d24710e442babe ]

If no monitoring feature is detected because all monitoring features are
disabled during boot time or there is no monitoring feature in hardware,
creating rdtgroup sub-directory by "mkdir" command reports error:

  mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/sys/fs/resctrl/p1’: No such file or directory

But the sub-directory actually is generated and content is correct:

  cpus  cpus_list  schemata  tasks

The error is because rdtgroup_mkdir_ctrl_mon() returns non zero value after
the sub-directory is created and the returned value is reported as an error
to user.

Clear the returned value to report to user that the sub-directory is
actually created successfully.
