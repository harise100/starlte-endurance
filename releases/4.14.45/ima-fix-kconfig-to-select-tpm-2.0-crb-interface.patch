Subject: ima: Fix Kconfig to select TPM 2.0 CRB interface

From: Jiandi An <anjiandi@codeaurora.org>

[ Upstream commit fac37c628fd5d68fd7298d9b57ae8601ee1b4723 ]

TPM_CRB driver provides TPM CRB 2.0 support.  If it is built as a
module, the TPM chip is registered after IMA init.  tpm_pcr_read() in
IMA fails and displays the following message even though eventually
there is a TPM chip on the system.

ima: No TPM chip found, activating TPM-bypass! (rc=-19)

Fix IMA Kconfig to select TPM_CRB so TPM_CRB driver is built in the kernel
and initializes before IMA.
