Subject: ipvs: remove IPS_NAT_MASK check to fix passive FTP

From: Julian Anastasov <ja@ssi.bg>

[ Upstream commit 8a949fff0302b50063f74bb345a66190015528d0 ]

The IPS_NAT_MASK check in 4.12 replaced previous check for nfct_nat()
which was needed to fix a crash in 2.6.36-rc, see
commit 7bcbf81a2296 ("ipvs: avoid oops for passive FTP").
But as IPVS does not set the IPS_SRC_NAT and IPS_DST_NAT bits,
checking for IPS_NAT_MASK prevents PASV response to be properly
mangled and blocks the transfer. Remove the check as it is not
needed after 3.12 commit 41d73ec053d2 ("netfilter: nf_conntrack:
make sequence number adjustments usuable without NAT") which
changes nfct_nat() with nfct_seqadj() and especially after 3.13
commit b25adce16064 ("ipvs: correct usage/allocation of seqadj
ext in ipvs").

Thanks to Li Shuang and Florian Westphal for reporting the problem!
