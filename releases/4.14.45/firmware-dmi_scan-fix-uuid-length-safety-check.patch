Subject: firmware: dmi_scan: Fix UUID length safety check

From: Jean Delvare <jdelvare@suse.de>

[ Upstream commit 90fe6f8ff00a07641ca893d64f75ca22ce77cca2 ]

The test which ensures that the DMI type 1 structure is long enough
to hold the UUID is off by one. It would fail if the structure is
exactly 24 bytes long, while that's sufficient to hold the UUID.

I don't expect this bug to cause problem in practice because all
implementations I have seen had length 8, 25 or 27 bytes, in line
with the SMBIOS specifications. But let's fix it still.
