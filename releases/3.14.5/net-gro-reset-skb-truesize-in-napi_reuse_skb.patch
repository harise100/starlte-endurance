Subject: net-gro: reset skb->truesize in napi_reuse_skb()

From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

[ Upstream commit e33d0ba8047b049c9262fdb1fcafb93cb52ceceb ]

Recycling skb always had been very tough...

This time it appears GRO layer can accumulate skb->truesize
adjustments made by drivers when they attach a fragment to skb.

skb_gro_receive() can only subtract from skb->truesize the used part
of a fragment.

I spotted this problem seeing TcpExtPruneCalled and
TcpExtTCPRcvCollapsed that were unexpected with a recent kernel, where
TCP receive window should be sized properly to accept traffic coming
from a driver not overshooting skb->truesize.
