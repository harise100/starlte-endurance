Subject: batman-adv: fix removing neigh_ifinfo

From: Simon Wunderlich <simon@open-mesh.com>

[ Upstream commit 709de13f0c532fe9c468c094aff069a725ed57fe ]

When an interface is removed separately, all neighbors need to be
checked if they have a neigh_ifinfo structure for that particular
interface. If that is the case, remove that ifinfo so any references to
a hard interface can be freed.

This is a regression introduced by
89652331c00f43574515059ecbf262d26d885717
("batman-adv: split tq information in neigh_node struct")
