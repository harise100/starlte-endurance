commit a2a4dc494a7b7135f460e38e788c4a58f65e4ac3 upstream.

Commit 9e30cc9595303b27b48 removed an internal mount. This
has the side-effect that rootfs now has FSID 0. Many
userspace utilities assume that st_dev in struct stat
is never 0, so this change breaks a number of tools in
early userspace.

Since we don't know how many userspace programs are affected,
make sure that FSID is at least 1.
