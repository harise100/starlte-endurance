Subject: blk-mq-sched: dispatch from scheduler IFF progress is made in ->dispatch

From: Ming Lei <ming.lei@redhat.com>


[ Upstream commit 5e3d02bbafad38975099b5848f5ebadedcf7bb7e ]

When the hw queue is busy, we shouldn't take requests from the scheduler
queue any more, otherwise it is difficult to do IO merge.

This patch fixes the awful IO performance on some SCSI devices(lpfc,
qla2xxx, ...) when mq-deadline/kyber is used by not taking requests if
hw queue is busy.
