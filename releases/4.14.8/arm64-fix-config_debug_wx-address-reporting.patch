Subject: arm64: fix CONFIG_DEBUG_WX address reporting

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

commit 1d08a044cf12aee37dfd54837558e3295287b343 upstream.

In ptdump_check_wx(), we pass walk_pgd() a start address of 0 (rather
than VA_START) for the init_mm. This means that any reported W&X
addresses are offset by VA_START, which is clearly wrong and can make
them appear like userspace addresses.

Fix this by telling the ptdump code that we're walking init_mm starting
at VA_START. We don't need to update the addr_markers, since these are
still valid bounds regardless.

Fixes: 1404d6f13e47 ("arm64: dump: Add checking for writable and exectuable pages")
