Subject: ext4: support fast symlinks from ext3 file systems

From: Andi Kleen <ak@linux.intel.com>

commit fc82228a5e3860502dbf3bfa4a9570cb7093cf7f upstream.

407cd7fb83c0 (ext4: change fast symlink test to not rely on i_blocks)
broke ~10 years old ext3 file systems created by 2.6.17. Any ELF
executable fails because the /lib/ld-linux.so.2 fast symlink
cannot be read anymore.

The patch assumed fast symlinks were created in a specific way,
but that's not true on these really old file systems.

The new behavior is apparently needed only with the large EA inode
feature.

Revert to the old behavior if the large EA inode feature is not set.

This makes my old VM boot again.

Fixes: 407cd7fb83c0 (ext4: change fast symlink test to not rely on i_blocks)
