Subject: KVM: nVMX: Fix EPT switching advertising

From: Wanpeng Li <wanpeng.li@hotmail.com>


[ Upstream commit 575b3a2cb439b03fd603ea77c73c76f3ed237596 ]

I can use vmxcap tool to observe "EPTP Switching   yes" even if EPT is not
exposed to L1.

EPT switching is advertised unconditionally since it is emulated, however,
it can be treated as an extended feature for EPT and it should not be
advertised if EPT itself is not exposed. This patch fixes it.
