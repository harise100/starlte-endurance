Subject: ARM: dts: OMAP5 / DRA7: indicate that SATA port 0 is available.

From: Jean-Jacques Hiblot <jjhiblot@ti.com>

commit 87cb12910a2ab6ed41ae951ea4d9c1cc1120199a upstream.

AHCI provides the register PORTS_IMPL to let the software know which port
is supported. The register must be initialized by the bootloader. However
in some cases u-boot doesn't properly initialize this value (if it is not
compiled with SATA support for example or if the SATA initialization fails).
The DTS entry "ports-implemented" can be used to override the value in
PORTS_IMPL.

Without this patch the SATA will not work in the following two cases:

* if there has been a failure to initialize SATA in u-boot.

* if ahci_platform module has been removed and re-inserted. The reason is
  that the content of PORTS_IMPL is lost after the module is removed.
  I suspect that it's because the controller is reset by the hwmod.
