Subject: ARM: dts: am4372: Add an empty chosen node to top level DTSI

From: Javier Martinez Canillas <javier@osg.samsung.com>

commit ce95077d0cdfcc8e40dea10a1680249831ccec77 upstream.

Commit 75813028bbd7 ("ARM: dts: am4372: Remove skeleton.dtsi usage")
removed the skeleton.dtsi usage since we want to get rid of it.

But this can cause issues when booting a kernel with a boot-loader
that doesn't create a chosen node if this isn't present in the DTB
since the decompressor relies on a pre-existing chosen node to be
available to insert the command line and merge other ATAGS info.
