Subject: ARM: dts: imx31: fix AVIC base address

From: Vladimir Zapolskiy <vladimir_zapolskiy@mentor.com>

commit af92305e567b7f4c9cf48b9e46c1f48ec9ffb1fb upstream.

On i.MX31 AVIC interrupt controller base address is at 0x68000000.

The problem was shadowed by the AVIC driver, which takes the correct
base address from a SoC specific header file.

Fixes: d2a37b3d91f4 ("ARM i.MX31: Add devicetree support")
