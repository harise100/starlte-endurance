Subject: udf: Use device size when drive reported bogus number of written blocks

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit 24a5d59f3477bcff4c069ff4d0ca9a3e037d0235 upstream.

Some drives report 0 as the number of written blocks when there are some blocks
recorded. Use device size in such case so that we can automagically mount such
media.
