Subject: xfs: use iomap new flag for newly allocated delalloc blocks

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

commit f65e6fad293b3a5793b7fa2044800506490e7a2e upstream.

Commit fa7f138 ("xfs: clear delalloc and cache on buffered write
failure") fixed one regression in the iomap error handling code and
exposed another. The fundamental problem is that if a buffered write
is a rewrite of preexisting delalloc blocks and the write fails, the
failure handling code can punch out preexisting blocks with valid
file data.

This was reproduced directly by sub-block writes in the LTP
kernel/syscalls/write/write03 test. A first 100 byte write allocates
a single block in a file. A subsequent 100 byte write fails and
punches out the block, including the data successfully written by
the previous write.

To address this problem, update the ->iomap_begin() handler to
distinguish newly allocated delalloc blocks from preexisting
delalloc blocks via the IOMAP_F_NEW flag. Use this flag in the
->iomap_end() handler to decide when a failed or short write should
punch out delalloc blocks.

This introduces the subtle requirement that ->iomap_begin() should
never combine newly allocated delalloc blocks with existing blocks
in the resulting iomap descriptor. This can occur when a new
delalloc reservation merges with a neighboring extent that is part
of the current write, for example. Therefore, drop the
post-allocation extent lookup from xfs_bmapi_reserve_delalloc() and
just return the record inserted into the fork. This ensures only new
blocks are returned and thus that preexisting delalloc blocks are
always handled as "found" blocks and not punched out on a failed
rewrite.
