Subject: ipc/sem.c: synchronize the proc interface

From: Manfred Spraul <manfred@colorfullife.com>

commit d8c633766ad88527f25d9f81a5c2f083d78a2b39 upstream.

The proc interface is not aware of sem_lock(), it instead calls
ipc_lock_object() directly.  This means that simple semop() operations
can run in parallel with the proc interface.  Right now, this is
uncritical, because the implementation doesn't do anything that requires
a proper synchronization.

But it is dangerous and therefore should be fixed.
