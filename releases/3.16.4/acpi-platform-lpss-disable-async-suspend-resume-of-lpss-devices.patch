Subject: ACPI / platform / LPSS: disable async suspend/resume of LPSS devices

From: Fu Zhonghui <zhonghui.fu@linux.intel.com>

commit 457920817e645a7dee42c2a75c81c5ed8e12ee1c upstream.

On some systems (Asus T100 in particular) there are strict ordering
dependencies between LPSS devices with respect to power management
that break if they suspend/resume asynchronously.

In theory it should be possible to follow those dependencies in the
async suspend/resume case too (the ACPI tables tell as that the
dependencies are there), but since we're missing infrastructure
for that at the moment, disable async suspend/resume for all of
the LPSS devices for the time being.
