Subject: aio: block exit_aio() until all context requests are completed

From: Gu Zheng <guz.fnst@cn.fujitsu.com>

commit 6098b45b32e6baeacc04790773ced9340601d511 upstream.

It seems that exit_aio() also needs to wait for all iocbs to complete (like
io_destroy), but we missed the wait step in current implemention, so fix
it in the same way as we did in io_destroy.
