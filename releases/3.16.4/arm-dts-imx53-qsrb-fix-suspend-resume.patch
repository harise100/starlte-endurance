Subject: ARM: dts: imx53-qsrb: Fix suspend/resume

From: Fabio Estevam <fabio.estevam@freescale.com>

commit 090727b880ff3c56e333f267cc24ab076f3bc096 upstream.

The following error is seen after a suspend/resume cycle on a mx53qsb with a
MC34708 PMIC:

Commit 5169df8be0a432ee ("ARM: dts: i.MX53: add support for MCIMX53-START-R")
missed to configure the IOMUX for the PMIC IRQ pin.

Configure the PMIC IRQ pin so that the suspend/resume sequence behaves cleanly
as expected.
