Subject: USB: storage: Add quirks for Entrega/Xircom USB to SCSI converters

From: Mark <markk@clara.co.uk>

commit c80b4495c61636edc58fe1ce300f09f24db28e10 upstream.

This patch adds quirks for Entrega Technologies (later Xircom PortGear) USB-
SCSI converters. They use Shuttle Technology EUSB-01/EUSB-S1 chips. The
US_FL_SCM_MULT_TARG quirk is needed to allow multiple devices on the SCSI
chain to be accessed. Without it only the (single) device with SCSI ID 0
can be used.

The standalone converter sold by Entrega had model number U1-SC25. Xircom
acquired Entrega and re-branded the product line PortGear. The PortGear USB
to SCSI Converter (model PGSCSI) is internally identical to the Entrega
product, but later models may use a different USB ID. The Entrega-branded
units have USB ID 1645:0007, as does my Xircom PGSCSI, but the Windows and
Macintosh drivers also support 085A:0028.

Entrega also sold the "Mac USB Dock", which provides two USB ports, a Mac
(8-pin mini-DIN) serial port and a SCSI port. It appears to the computer as
a four-port hub, USB-serial, and USB-SCSI converters. The USB-SCSI part may
have initially used the same ID as the standalone U1-SC25 (1645:0007), but
later production used 085A:0026.

My Xircom PortGear PGSCSI has bcdDevice=0x0100. Units with bcdDevice=0x0133
probably also exist.

This patch adds quirks for 1645:0007, 085A:0026 and 085A:0028. The Windows
driver INF file also mentions 085A:0032 "PortStation SCSI Module", but I
couldn't find any mention of that actually existing in the wild; perhaps it
was cancelled before release?
