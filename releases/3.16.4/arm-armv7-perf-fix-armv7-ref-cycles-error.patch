Subject: arm: armv7: perf: fix armv7 ref-cycles error
To: <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>, <lizefan@huawei.com>, <wangnan0@huawei.com>, <stable@vger.kernel.org>, <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Message-ID: <54251956.6010407@huawei.com>


From: Zhiqiang Zhang <zhangzhiqiang.zhang@huawei.com>

ref-cycles event is specially to Intel core, but can still used in arm
architecture with the wrong return value with 3.10 stable. this patch fix the
bug and make it return NOT SUPPORTED distinctly.

In upstream this bug has been fixed by other way, which changes more than one
file and more than 1000 lines. the primary commit is
6b7658ec8a100b608e59e3cde353434db51f5be0.  besides we can not simply
cherry-pick.
