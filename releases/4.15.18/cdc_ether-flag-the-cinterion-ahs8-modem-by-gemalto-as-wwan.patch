Subject: cdc_ether: flag the Cinterion AHS8 modem by gemalto as WWAN

From: Bassem Boubaker <bassem.boubaker@actia.fr>


[ Upstream commit 53765341ee821c0a0f1dec41adc89c9096ad694c ]

The Cinterion AHS8 is a 3G device with one embedded WWAN interface
using cdc_ether as a driver.

The modem is controlled via AT commands through the exposed TTYs.

AT+CGDCONT write command can be used to activate or deactivate a WWAN
connection for a PDP context defined with the same command. UE
supports one WWAN adapter.
