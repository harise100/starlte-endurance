Subject: Revert "libceph: use memalloc flags for net IO"

From: Ilya Dryomov <idryomov@gmail.com>

commit 6d7fdb0ab351b33d4c12d53fe44be030b90fc9d4 upstream.

This reverts commit 89baaa570ab0b476db09408d209578cfed700e9f.

Dirty page throttling should be sufficient for us in the general case
so there is no need to use __GFP_MEMALLOC - it would be needed only in
the swap-over-rbd case, which we currently don't support.  (It would
probably take approximately the commit that is being reverted to add
that support, but we would also need the "swap" option to distinguish
from the general case and make sure swap ceph_client-s aren't shared
with anything else.)  See ceph-devel threads [1] and [2] for the
details of why enabling pfmemalloc reserves for all cases is a bad
thing.

On top of potential system lockups related to drained emergency
reserves, this turned out to cause ceph lockups in case peers are on
the same host and communicating via loopback due to sk_filter()
dropping pfmemalloc skbs on the receiving side because the receiving
loopback socket is not tagged with SOCK_MEMALLOC.
