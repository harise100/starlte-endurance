Subject: powerpc: fix memory corruption by pnv_alloc_idle_core_states

From: Jan Stancek <jstancek@redhat.com>

commit d52356e7f48e400ca258c6763a232a92fa82ff68 upstream.

Space allocated for paca is based off nr_cpu_ids,
but pnv_alloc_idle_core_states() iterates paca with
cpu_nr_cores()*threads_per_core, which is using NR_CPUS.

This causes pnv_alloc_idle_core_states() to write over memory,
which is outside of paca array and may later lead to various panics.

Fixes: 7cba160ad789 (powernv/cpuidle: Redesign idle states management)
