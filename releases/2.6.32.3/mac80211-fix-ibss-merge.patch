Subject: mac80211: Fix IBSS merge

From: Sujith <Sujith.Manoharan@atheros.com>

commit 450aae3d7b60a970f266349a837dfb30a539198b upstream.

Currently, in IBSS mode, a single creator would go into
a loop trying to merge/scan. This happens because the IBSS timer is
rearmed on finishing a scan and the subsequent
timer invocation requests another scan immediately.

This patch fixes this issue by checking if we have just completed
a scan run trying to merge with other IBSS networks.
