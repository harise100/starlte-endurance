Subject: V4L/DVB (13596): ov511.c typo: lock => unlock

From: Dan Carpenter <error27@gmail.com>

commit 50e9d31183ed61c787b870cb3ee8f6c3db8c8a1e upstream.

This was found with a static checker and has not been tested, but it seems
pretty clear that the mutex_lock() was supposed to be mutex_unlock()
