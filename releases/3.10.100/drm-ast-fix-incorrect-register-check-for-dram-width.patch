Subject: drm/ast: Fix incorrect register check for DRAM width

From: Timothy Pearson <tpearson@raptorengineeringinc.com>

commit 2d02b8bdba322b527c5f5168ce1ca10c2d982a78 upstream.

During DRAM initialization on certain ASpeed devices, an incorrect
bit (bit 10) was checked in the "SDRAM Bus Width Status" register
to determine DRAM width.

Query bit 6 instead in accordance with the Aspeed AST2050 datasheet v1.05.
