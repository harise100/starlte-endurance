Subject: ARM: dts: omap4/5: Use l3_ick for the gpmc node

From: Florian Vaussard <florian.vaussard@epfl.ch>

commit 7b8b6af169a069454936053631d151a50af7b69a upstream.

The GPMC clock is derived from l3_ick. The simplest solution is
to reference directly l3_ick to provide the GPMC fck in order to
get correct timings. The real management of the clock is left to
hwmod.
