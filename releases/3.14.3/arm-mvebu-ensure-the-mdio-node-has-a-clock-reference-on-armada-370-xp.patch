Subject: ARM: mvebu: ensure the mdio node has a clock reference on Armada 370/XP

From: Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@free-electrons.com>

commit a6e03dd451c724f785277d8ecca5d1a0b886d892 upstream.

The mvmdio driver accesses some register of the Ethernet unit. It
therefore takes a reference and enables a clock. However, on Armada
370/XP, no clock specification was given in the Device Tree, which
leads the mvmdio driver to fail when being used as a module and loaded
before the mvneta driver: it tries to access a register from a
hardware unit that isn't clocked.
