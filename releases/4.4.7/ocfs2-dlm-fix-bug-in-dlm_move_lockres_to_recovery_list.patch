Subject: ocfs2/dlm: fix BUG in dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list

From: Joseph Qi <joseph.qi@huawei.com>

commit be12b299a83fc807bbaccd2bcb8ec50cbb0cb55c upstream.

When master handles convert request, it queues ast first and then
returns status.  This may happen that the ast is sent before the request
status because the above two messages are sent by two threads.  And
right after the ast is sent, if master down, it may trigger BUG in
dlm_move_lockres_to_recovery_list in the requested node because ast
handler moves it to grant list without clear lock->convert_pending.  So
remove BUG_ON statement and check if the ast is processed in
dlmconvert_remote.
