Subject: ALSA: pcm: Avoid "BUG:" string for warnings again

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 0ab1ace856205d10cbc1924b2d931c01ffd216a6 upstream.

The commit [d507941beb1e: ALSA: pcm: Correct PCM BUG error message]
made the warning prefix back to "BUG:" due to its previous wrong
prefix.  But a kernel message containing "BUG:" seems taken as an Oops
message wrongly by some brain-dead daemons, and it annoys users in the
end.  Instead of teaching daemons, change the string again to a more
reasonable one.

Fixes: 507941beb1e ('ALSA: pcm: Correct PCM BUG error message')
