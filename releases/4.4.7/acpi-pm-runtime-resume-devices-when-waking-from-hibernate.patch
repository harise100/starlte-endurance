Subject: ACPI / PM: Runtime resume devices when waking from hibernate

From: Lukas Wunner <lukas@wunner.de>

commit fbda4b38fa3995aa0777fe9cbbdcb223c6292083 upstream.

Commit 58a1fbbb2ee8 ("PM / PCI / ACPI: Kick devices that might have been
reset by firmware") added a runtime resume for devices that were runtime
suspended when the system entered suspend-to-RAM.

Briefly, the motivation was to ensure that devices did not remain in a
reset-power-on state after resume, potentially preventing deep SoC-wide
low-power states from being entered on idle.

Currently we're not doing the same when leaving suspend-to-disk and this
asymmetry is a problem if drivers rely on the automatic resume triggered
by pm_complete_with_resume_check(). Fix it.
