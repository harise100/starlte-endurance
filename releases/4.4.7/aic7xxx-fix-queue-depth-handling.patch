Subject: aic7xxx: Fix queue depth handling

From: Alan <gnomes@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>

commit 5a51a7abca133860a6f4429655a9eda3c4afde32 upstream.

We were setting the queue depth correctly, then setting it back to
two. If you hit this as a bisection point then please send me an email
as it would imply we've been hiding other bugs with this one.
