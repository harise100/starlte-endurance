Subject: mac80211: fix power saving clients handling in iwlwifi

From: Emmanuel Grumbach <emmanuel.grumbach@intel.com>


[ Upstream commit d98937f4ea713d21e0fcc345919f86c877dd8d6f ]

iwlwifi now supports RSS and can't let mac80211 track the
PS state based on the Rx frames since they can come out of
order. iwlwifi is now advertising AP_LINK_PS, and uses
explicit notifications to teach mac80211 about the PS state
of the stations and the PS poll / uAPSD trigger frames
coming our way from the peers.

Because of that, the TIM stopped being maintained in
mac80211. I tried to fix this in commit c68df2e7be0c
("mac80211: allow using AP_LINK_PS with mac80211-generated TIM IE")
but that was later reverted by Felix in commit 6c18a6b4e799
("Revert "mac80211: allow using AP_LINK_PS with mac80211-generated TIM IE")
since it broke drivers that do not implement set_tim.

Since none of the drivers that set AP_LINK_PS have the
set_tim() handler set besides iwlwifi, I can bail out in
__sta_info_recalc_tim if AP_LINK_PS AND .set_tim is not
implemented.
