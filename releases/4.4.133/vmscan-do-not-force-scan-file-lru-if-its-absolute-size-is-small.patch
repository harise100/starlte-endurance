Subject: vmscan: do not force-scan file lru if its absolute size is small

From: Vladimir Davydov <vdavydov@virtuozzo.com>

commit 316bda0e6cc5f36f94b4af8bded16d642c90ad75 upstream.

We assume there is enough inactive page cache if the size of inactive
file lru is greater than the size of active file lru, in which case we
force-scan file lru ignoring anonymous pages.  While this logic works
fine when there are plenty of page cache pages, it fails if the size of
file lru is small (several MB): in this case (lru_size >> prio) will be
0 for normal scan priorities, as a result, if inactive file lru happens
to be larger than active file lru, anonymous pages of a cgroup will
never get evicted unless the system experiences severe memory pressure,
even if there are gigabytes of unused anonymous memory there, which is
unfair in respect to other cgroups, whose workloads might be page cache
oriented.

This patch attempts to fix this by elaborating the "enough inactive page
cache" check: it makes it not only check that inactive lru size > active
lru size, but also that we will scan something from the cgroup at the
current scan priority.  If these conditions do not hold, we proceed to
SCAN_FRACT as usual.
