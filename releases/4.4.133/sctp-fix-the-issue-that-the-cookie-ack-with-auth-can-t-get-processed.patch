Subject: sctp: fix the issue that the cookie-ack with auth can't get processed

From: Xin Long <lucien.xin@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit ce402f044e4e432c296f90eaabb8dbe8f3624391 ]

When auth is enabled for cookie-ack chunk, in sctp_inq_pop, sctp
processes auth chunk first, then continues to the next chunk in
this packet if chunk_end + chunk_hdr size < skb_tail_pointer().
Otherwise, it will go to the next packet or discard this chunk.

However, it missed the fact that cookie-ack chunk's size is equal
to chunk_hdr size, which couldn't match that check, and thus this
chunk would not get processed.

This patch fixes it by changing the check to chunk_end + chunk_hdr
size <= skb_tail_pointer().
