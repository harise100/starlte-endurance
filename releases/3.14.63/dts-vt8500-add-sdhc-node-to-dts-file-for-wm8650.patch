Subject: dts: vt8500: Add SDHC node to DTS file for WM8650

From: Roman Volkov <rvolkov@v1ros.org>

commit 0f090bf14e51e7eefb71d9d1c545807f8b627986 upstream.

Since WM8650 has the same 'WMT' SDHC controller as WM8505, and the driver
is already in the kernel, this node enables the controller support for
WM8650
