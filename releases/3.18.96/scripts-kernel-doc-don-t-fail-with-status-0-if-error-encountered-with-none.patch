Subject: scripts/kernel-doc: Don't fail with status != 0 if error encountered with -none

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>


[ Upstream commit e814bccbafece52a24e152d2395b5d49eef55841 ]

My bisect scripts starting running into build failures when trying to
compile 4.15-rc1 with the builds failing with things like:

drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/sdio.c:2078: error: Cannot parse struct or union!

The line in question is actually just a #define, but after some digging
it turns out that my scripts pass W=1 and since commit 3a025e1d1c2ea
("Add optional check for bad kernel-doc comments") that results in
kernel-doc running on each source file. The file in question has a
badly formatted comment immediately before the #define:

/**
 * struct brcmf_skbuff_cb reserves first two bytes in sk_buff::cb for
 * bus layer usage.
 */

which causes the regex in dump_struct to fail (lack of braces following
struct declaration) and kernel-doc returns 1, which causes the build
to fail.

Fix the issue by always returning 0 from kernel-doc when invoked with
-none. It successfully generates no documentation, and prints out any
issues.
