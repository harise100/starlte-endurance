Subject: thinkpad-acpi: disable broken bay and dock subdrivers

From: Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@hmh.eng.br>

commit 550e7fd8afb7664ae7cedb398c407694e2bf7d3c upstream.

Currently, the ThinkPad-ACPI bay and dock drivers are completely
broken, and cause a NULL pointer derreference in kernel mode (and,
therefore, an OOPS) when they try to issue events (i.e. on dock,
undock, bay ejection, etc).

OTOH, the standard ACPI dock driver can handle the hotplug bays and
docks of the ThinkPads just fine (including batteries) as of 2.6.27.
In fact, it does a much better job of it than thinkpad-acpi ever did.

It is just not worth the hassle to find a way to fix this crap without
breaking the (deprecated) thinkpad-acpi dock/bay ABI.  This is old,
deprecated code that sees little testing or use.

As a quick fix suitable for -stable backports, mark the thinkpad-acpi
bay and dock subdrivers as BROKEN in Kconfig.  The dead code will be
removed by a later patch.

This fixes bugzilla #13669, and should be applied to 2.6.27 and later.
