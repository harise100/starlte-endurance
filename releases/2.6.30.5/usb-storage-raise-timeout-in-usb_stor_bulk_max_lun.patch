Subject: USB: storage: raise timeout in usb_stor_Bulk_max_lun

From: Giacomo Lozito <james@develia.org>

commit 7a777919bbeec3eac1d7904a728a60e9c2bb9c67 upstream.

Requests to get max LUN, for certain USB storage devices, require a
longer timeout before a correct reply is returned. This happens for a
Realtek USB Card Reader (0bda:0152), which has a max LUN of 3 but is set
to 0, thus losing functionality, because of the timeout occurring too
quickly.

Raising the timeout value fixes the issue and might help other devices
to return a correct max LUN value as well.
