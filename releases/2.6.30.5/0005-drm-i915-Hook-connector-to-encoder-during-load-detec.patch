Subject: drm/i915: Hook connector to encoder during load detection (fixes tv/vga detect)

From: Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>

(cherry picked from commit 03d6069912babc07a3da20e715dd6a5dc8f0f867)

With the DRM-driven DPMS code, encoders are considered idle unless a
connector is hooked to them, so mode setting is skipped. This makes load
detection fail as none of the hardware is enabled.
