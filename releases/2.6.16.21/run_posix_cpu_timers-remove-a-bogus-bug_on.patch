Subject: run_posix_cpu_timers: remove a bogus BUG_ON() (CVE-2006-2445)

do_exit() clears ->it_##clock##_expires, but nothing prevents
another cpu to attach the timer to exiting process after that.
arm_timer() tries to protect against this race, but the check
is racy.

After exit_notify() does 'write_unlock_irq(&tasklist_lock)' and
before do_exit() calls 'schedule() local timer interrupt can find
tsk->exit_state != 0. If that state was EXIT_DEAD (or another cpu
does sys_wait4) interrupted task has ->signal == NULL.

At this moment exiting task has no pending cpu timers, they were
cleanuped in __exit_signal()->posix_cpu_timers_exit{,_group}(),
so we can just return from irq.

John Stultz recently confirmed this bug, see
