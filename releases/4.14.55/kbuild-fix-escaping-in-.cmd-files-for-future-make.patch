commit 9564a8cf422d7b58f6e857e3546d346fa970191e upstream.

I tried building using a freshly built Make (4.2.1-69-g8a731d1), but
already the objtool build broke with

orc_dump.c: In function ‘orc_dump’:
orc_dump.c:106:2: error: ‘elf_getshnum’ is deprecated [-Werror=deprecated-declarations]
  if (elf_getshdrnum(elf, &nr_sections)) {

Turns out that with that new Make, the backslash was not removed, so cpp
didn't see a #include directive, grep found nothing, and
-DLIBELF_USE_DEPRECATED was wrongly put in CFLAGS.

Now, that new Make behaviour is documented in their NEWS file:

  * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
    Number signs (#) appearing inside a macro reference or function invocation
    no longer introduce comments and should not be escaped with backslashes:
    thus a call such as:
      foo := $(shell echo '#')
    is legal.  Previously the number sign needed to be escaped, for example:
      foo := $(shell echo '\#')
    Now this latter will resolve to "\#".  If you want to write makefiles
    portable to both versions, assign the number sign to a variable:
      C := \#
      foo := $(shell echo '$C')
    This was claimed to be fixed in 3.81, but wasn't, for some reason.
    To detect this change search for 'nocomment' in the .FEATURES variable.

This also fixes up the two make-cmd instances to replace # with $(pound)
rather than with \#. There might very well be other places that need
similar fixup in preparation for whatever future Make release contains
the above change, but at least this builds an x86_64 defconfig with the
new make.
