Subject: xfs: fix unaligned access in xfs_btree_visit_blocks

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@sandeen.net>

commit a4d768e702de224cc85e0c8eac9311763403b368 upstream.

This structure copy was throwing unaligned access warnings on sparc64:

Kernel unaligned access at TPC[1043c088] xfs_btree_visit_blocks+0x88/0xe0 [xfs]

xfs_btree_copy_ptrs does a memcpy, which avoids it.
