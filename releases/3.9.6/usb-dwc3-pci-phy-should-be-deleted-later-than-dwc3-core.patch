Subject: usb: dwc3: pci: PHY should be deleted later than dwc3 core

From: Peter Chen <peter.chen@freescale.com>

commit f28c42c576b293b3a1daaed8ca2775ebc2fe5398 upstream.

If the glue layer is removed first (core layer later),
it deletes the phy device first, then the core device.
But at core's removal, it still uses PHY's resources, it may
cause kernel's oops. It is much like the problem
Paul Zimmerman reported at:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=136547502011472&w=2.

Besides, it is reasonable the PHY is deleted at last as
the controller is the PHY's user.
