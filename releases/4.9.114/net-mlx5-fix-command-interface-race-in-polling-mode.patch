Subject: net/mlx5: Fix command interface race in polling mode

From: Alex Vesker <valex@mellanox.com>

[ Upstream commit d412c31dae053bf30a1bc15582a9990df297a660 ]

The command interface can work in two modes: Events and Polling.
In the general case, each time we invoke a command, a work is
queued to handle it.

When working in events, the interrupt handler completes the
command execution. On the other hand, when working in polling
mode, the work itself completes it.

Due to a bug in the work handler, a command could have been
completed by the interrupt handler, while the work handler
hasn't finished yet, causing the it to complete once again
if the command interface mode was changed from Events to
polling after the interrupt handler was called.

mlx5_unload_one()
        mlx5_stop_eqs()
                // Destroy the EQ before cmd EQ
                ...cmd_work_handler()
                        write_doorbell()
                        --> EVENT_TYPE_CMD
                                mlx5_cmd_comp_handler() // First free
                                        free_ent(cmd, ent->idx)
                                        complete(&ent->done)

        <-- mlx5_stop_eqs //cmd was complete
                // move to polling before destroying the last cmd EQ
                mlx5_cmd_use_polling()
                        cmd->mode = POLL;

                --> cmd_work_handler (continues)
                        if (cmd->mode == POLL)
                                mlx5_cmd_comp_handler() // Double free

The solution is to store the cmd->mode before writing the doorbell.
