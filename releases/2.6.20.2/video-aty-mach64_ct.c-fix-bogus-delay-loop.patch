[PATCH] video/aty/mach64_ct.c: fix bogus delay loop

CT based mach64 cards were reported to hang on sparc64 boxes when
compiled with gcc-4.1.x and later.

Looking at this piece of code, it's no surprise.  A critical
delay was implemented as an empty for() loop, and gcc 4.0.x
and previous did not optimize it away, so we did get a delay.

But gcc-4.1.x and later can optimize it away, and we get crashes.

Use a real udelay() to fix this.  Fix verified on SunBlade100.
