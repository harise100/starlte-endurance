Subject: crush: adjust local retry threshold

From: Sage Weil <sage@inktank.com>

(cherry picked from commit c90f95ed46393e29d843686e21947d1c6fcb1164)

This small adjustment reflects a change that was made in ceph.git commit
af6a9f30696c900a2a8bd7ae24e8ed15fb4964bb, about 6 months ago.  An N-1
search is not exhaustive.  Fixed ceph.git bug #1594.
