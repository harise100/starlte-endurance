Subject: bpf, ppc64: fix out of bounds access in tail call

[ upstream commit d269176e766c71c998cb75b4ea8cbc321cc0019d ]

While working on 16338a9b3ac3 ("bpf, arm64: fix out of bounds access in
tail call") I noticed that ppc64 JIT is partially affected as well. While
the bound checking is correctly performed as unsigned comparison, the
register with the index value however, is never truncated into 32 bit
space, so e.g. a index value of 0x100000000ULL with a map of 1 element
would pass with PPC_CMPLW() whereas we later on continue with the full
64 bit register value. Therefore, as we do in interpreter and other JITs
truncate the value to 32 bit initially in order to fix access.
