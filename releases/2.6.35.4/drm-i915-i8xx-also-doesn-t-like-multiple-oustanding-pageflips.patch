Subject: drm/i915: i8xx also doesn't like multiple oustanding pageflips

From: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>

commit 6146b3d61925116e3fecce36c2fd873665bd6614 upstream.

My i855GM suffers from a 80k/s interrupt storm without this.
So add 2nd gen to the list of things that don't like more than
one outstanding pageflip request.

Furthermore I've changed the busy loop into a ringbuffer wait.
Busy-loops that don't check whether the chip died are simply evil.
And performance should actually improve, because there's usually
a decent amount of rendering queued on the gpu, hopefully rendering
that MI_WAIT into a noop by the time it's executed.

The current code holds dev->struct_mutex while executing this loop,
hence stalling all other gem activity anyway.
