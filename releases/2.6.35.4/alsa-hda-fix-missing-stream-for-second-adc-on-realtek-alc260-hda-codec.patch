Subject: ALSA: hda - Fix missing stream for second ADC on Realtek ALC260 HDA codec

From: Jonathan Woithe <jwoithe@physics.adelaide.edu.au>

commit 53bacfbbb2ddd981287b58a511c8b8f5df179886 upstream.

I discovered tonight that ALSA no longer sets up a stream for the second ADC
provided by the Realtek ALC260 HDA codec.  At some point alc_build_pcms()
started using stream_analog_alt_capture when constructing the second ADC
stream, but patch_alc260() was never updated accordingly.  I have no idea
when this regression occurred.  The trivial patch to patch_alc260() given
below fixes the problem as far as I can tell.  The patch is against 2.6.35.
