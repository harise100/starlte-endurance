Subject: Oprofile: Change CPUIDS from decimal to hex, and add some comments

From: John Villalovos <sodarock@gmail.com>

commit 45c34e05c4e3d36e7c44e790241ea11a1d90d54e upstream.

Back when the patch was submitted for "Add Xeon 7500 series support to
oprofile", Robert Richter had asked for a followon patch that
converted all the CPU ID values to hex.

I have done that here for the "i386/core_i7" and "i386/atom" class
processors in the ppro_init() function and also added some comments on
where to find documentation on the Intel processors.
