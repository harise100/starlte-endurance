Subject: dm raid1: wake kmirrord when requeueing delayed bios after remote recovery

From: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>

commit 69885683d22d8c05910fd808c01fdce1322739b4 upstream.

The recent commit 7513c2a761d69d2a93f17146b3563527d3618ba0 (dm raid1:
add is_remote_recovering hook for clusters) changed do_writes() to
update the ms->writes list but forgot to wake up kmirrord to process it.

The rule is that when anything is being added on ms->reads, ms->writes
or ms->failures and the list was empty before we must call
wakeup_mirrord (for immediate processing) or delayed_wake (for delayed
processing).  Otherwise the bios could sit on the list indefinitely.
