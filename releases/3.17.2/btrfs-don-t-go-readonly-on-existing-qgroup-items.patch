Subject: btrfs: don't go readonly on existing qgroup items

From: Mark Fasheh <mfasheh@suse.de>

commit 0b4699dcb65c2cff793210b07f40b98c2d423a43 upstream.

btrfs_drop_snapshot() leaves subvolume qgroup items on disk after
completion. This can cause problems with snapshot creation. If a new
snapshot tries to claim the deleted subvolumes id, btrfs will get -EEXIST
from add_qgroup_item() and go read-only. The following commands will
reproduce this problem (assume btrfs is on /dev/sda and is mounted at
/btrfs)

mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sda
mount -t btrfs /dev/sda /btrfs/
btrfs quota enable /btrfs/
btrfs su sna /btrfs/ /btrfs/snap
btrfs su de /btrfs/snap
sleep 45
umount /btrfs/
mount -t btrfs /dev/sda /btrfs/

We can fix this by catching -EEXIST in add_qgroup_item() and
initializing the existing items. We have the problem of orphaned
relation items being on disk from an old snapshot but that is outside
the scope of this patch.
