(cherry picked from commit d2b213f7b76f187c4391079c7581d3a08b940133)

Frank Bennett reported that ivtv was causing skype to crash. With help
from one of their developers he showed it was a kernel problem.
VIDIOCGCAP copies a name into a fixed length buffer - ivtv uses names
that are too long and does not truncate them so corrupts a few bytes of
the app data area.

Possibly the names also want trimming but for now this should fix the
corruption case.
