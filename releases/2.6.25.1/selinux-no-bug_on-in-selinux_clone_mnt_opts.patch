Subject: SELinux: no BUG_ON(!ss_initialized) in selinux_clone_mnt_opts

commit 0f5e64200f20fc8f5b759c4010082f577ab0af3f upstream

The Fedora installer actually makes multiple NFS mounts before it loads
selinux policy.  The code in selinux_clone_mnt_opts() assumed that the
init process would always be loading policy before NFS was up and
running.  It might be possible to hit this in a diskless environment as
well, I'm not sure.  There is no need to BUG_ON() in this situation
since we can safely continue given the circumstances.
