Subject: CacheFiles: Fix error handling in cachefiles_determine_cache_security()

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

commit 7ac512aa8237c43331ffaf77a4fd8b8d684819ba upstream.

cachefiles_determine_cache_security() is expected to return with a
security override in place.  However, if set_create_files_as() fails, we
fail to do this.  In this case, we should just reinstate the security
override that was set by the caller.

Furthermore, if set_create_files_as() fails, we should dispose of the
new credentials we were in the process of creating.
