Subject: bridge: fix potential crash in __netdev_pick_tx()

From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

[ Upstream commit a7d35f9d73e9ffa74a02304b817e579eec632f67 ]

Commit c29390c6dfee ("xps: must clear sender_cpu before forwarding")
fixed an issue in normal forward path, caused by sender_cpu & napi_id
skb fields being an union.

Bridge is another point where skb can be forwarded, so we need
the same cure.

Bug triggers if packet was received on a NIC using skb_mark_napi_id()

Fixes: 2bd82484bb4c ("xps: fix xps for stacked devices")
