Subject: SELinux: fix an oops with NetLabel and non-MLS SELinux policy

In the case where a user has configured NetLabel in the kernel but is not
using a SELinux policy with the MLS/MCS feature enabled there is a bug in
mls_export_cat() where a NULL pointer is used.  The initial problem report and
discussion can be found here (this patch has been ACK'd by Stephen Smalley and
 James Morris in the discussion thread below):

 * http://marc2.theaimsgroup.com/?t=116920302500004&r=1&w=2

This patch is specific to the 2.6.19.y kernel series as the mls_export_cat()
function has been replaced in the 2.6.20 kernel.
