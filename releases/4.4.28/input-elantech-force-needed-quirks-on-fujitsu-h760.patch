Subject: Input: elantech - force needed quirks on Fujitsu H760

From: Matti Kurkela <Matti.Kurkela@iki.fi>

commit f9a703a54d16ba2470391c4b12236ee56591d50c upstream.

Just like Fujitsu CELSIUS H730, the H760 also has an Elantech touchpad with
the same quirks. Without this patch, the touchpad is useless out-of-the-box
as the mouse pointer won't move.

This patch makes the driver aware of both the crc_enabled=1 requirement and
the middle button, making the touchpad fully functional out-of-the-box.
