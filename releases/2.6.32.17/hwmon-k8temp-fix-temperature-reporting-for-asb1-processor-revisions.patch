Subject: hwmon: (k8temp) Fix temperature reporting for ASB1 processor revisions

From: Andreas Herrmann <andreas.herrmann3@amd.com>

commit d535bad90dad4eb42ec6528043fcfb53627d4f89 upstream.

Reported temperature for ASB1 CPUs is too high.
Add ASB1 CPU revisions (these are also non-desktop variants) to the
list of CPUs for which the temperature fixup is not required.

Example: (from LENOVO ThinkPad Edge 13, 01972NG, system was idle)

  Current kernel reports

  $ sensors
  k8temp-pci-00c3
  Adapter: PCI adapter
  Core0 Temp:  +74.0 C
  Core0 Temp:  +70.0 C
  Core1 Temp:  +69.0 C
  Core1 Temp:  +70.0 C

  With this patch I have

  $ sensors
  k8temp-pci-00c3
  Adapter: PCI adapter
  Core0 Temp:  +54.0 C
  Core0 Temp:  +51.0 C
  Core1 Temp:  +48.0 C
  Core1 Temp:  +49.0 C
