Subject: cifs: remove bogus first_time check in NTLMv2 session setup code

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>

commit 8a224d489454b7457105848610cfebebdec5638d upstream.

This bug appears to be the result of a cut-and-paste mistake from the
NTLMv1 code. The function to generate the MAC key was commented out, but
not the conditional above it. The conditional then ended up causing the
session setup key not to be copied to the buffer unless this was the
first session on the socket, and that made all but the first NTLMv2
session setup fail.

Fix this by removing the conditional and all of the commented clutter
that made it difficult to see.
