Subject: ext4: stop issuing discards if not supported by device

commit a30eec2a8650a77f754e84b2e15f062fe652baa7 upstream (as of v2.6.34-git13)

Turn off issuance of discard requests if the device does
not support it - similar to the action we take for barriers.
This will save a little computation time if a non-discardable
device is mounted with -o discard, and also makes it obvious
that it's not doing what was asked at mount time ...
