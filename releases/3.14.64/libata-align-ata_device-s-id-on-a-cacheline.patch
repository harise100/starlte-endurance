Subject: libata: Align ata_device's id on a cacheline

From: Harvey Hunt <harvey.hunt@imgtec.com>

commit 4ee34ea3a12396f35b26d90a094c75db95080baa upstream.

The id buffer in ata_device is a DMA target, but it isn't explicitly
cacheline aligned. Due to this, adjacent fields can be overwritten with
stale data from memory on non coherent architectures. As a result, the
kernel is sometimes unable to communicate with an ATA device.

Fix this by ensuring that the id buffer is cacheline aligned.

This issue is similar to that fixed by Commit 84bda12af31f
("libata: align ap->sector_buf").
