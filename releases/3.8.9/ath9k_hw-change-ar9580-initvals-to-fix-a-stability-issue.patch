Subject: ath9k_hw: change AR9580 initvals to fix a stability issue

From: Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org>

commit f09a878511997c25a76bf111a32f6b8345a701a5 upstream.

The hardware parsing of Control Wrapper Frames needs to be disabled, as
it has been causing spurious decryption error reports. The initvals for
other chips have been updated to disable it, but AR9580 was left out for
some reason.
