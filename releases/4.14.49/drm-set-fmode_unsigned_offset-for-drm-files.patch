Subject: drm: set FMODE_UNSIGNED_OFFSET for drm files

From: Dave Airlie <airlied@redhat.com>

commit 76ef6b28ea4f81c3d511866a9b31392caa833126 upstream.

Since we have the ttm and gem vma managers using a subset
of the file address space for objects, and these start at
0x100000000 they will overflow the new mmap checks.

I've checked all the mmap routines I could see for any
bad behaviour but overall most people use GEM/TTM VMA
managers even the legacy drivers have a hashtable.
