Subject: ALSA: usb - Release capture substream URBs properly

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 76195fb096ca6db2f8bbaffb96e3025aaf1649a0 upstream.

Due to the wrong "return" in the loop, a capture substream won't be
released at disconnection properly if the device is capture only and has
no playback substream.  This caused Oops occasionally at the device
reconnection.
