Subject: net/sctp: Always set scope_id in sctp_inet6_skb_msgname

From: "Eric W. Biederman" <ebiederm@xmission.com>


[ Upstream commit 7c8a61d9ee1df0fb4747879fa67a99614eb62fec ]

Alexandar Potapenko while testing the kernel with KMSAN and syzkaller
discovered that in some configurations sctp would leak 4 bytes of
kernel stack.

Working with his reproducer I discovered that those 4 bytes that
are leaked is the scope id of an ipv6 address returned by recvmsg.

With a little code inspection and a shrewd guess I discovered that
sctp_inet6_skb_msgname only initializes the scope_id field for link
local ipv6 addresses to the interface index the link local address
pertains to instead of initializing the scope_id field for all ipv6
addresses.

That is almost reasonable as scope_id's are meaniningful only for link
local addresses.  Set the scope_id in all other cases to 0 which is
not a valid interface index to make it clear there is nothing useful
in the scope_id field.

There should be no danger of breaking userspace as the stack leak
guaranteed that previously meaningless random data was being returned.
