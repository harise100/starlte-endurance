Subject: ipv6: don't count addrconf generated routes against gc limit

From: Hannes Frederic Sowa <hannes@stressinduktion.org>

[ Upstream commit a3300ef4bbb1f1e33ff0400e1e6cf7733d988f4f ]

Brett Ciphery reported that new ipv6 addresses failed to get installed
because the addrconf generated dsts where counted against the dst gc
limit. We don't need to count those routes like we currently don't count
administratively added routes.

Because the max_addresses check enforces a limit on unbounded address
generation first in case someone plays with router advertisments, we
are still safe here.
