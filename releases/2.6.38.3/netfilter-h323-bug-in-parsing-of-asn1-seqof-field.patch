Subject: netfilter: h323: bug in parsing of ASN1 SEQOF field

From: David Sterba <dsterba@suse.cz>

commit b4232a22776aa5d063f890d21ca69870dbbe431b upstream.

Static analyzer of clang found a dead store which appears to be a bug in
reading count of items in SEQOF field, only the lower byte of word is
stored. This may lead to corrupted read and communication shutdown.

The bug has been in the module since it's first inclusion into linux
kernel.

[Patrick: the bug is real, but without practical consequence since the
 largest amount of sequence-of members we parse is 30.]
