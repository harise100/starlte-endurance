Subject: nfsd: fix auth_domain reference leak on nlm operations

From: J. Bruce Fields <bfields@redhat.com>

commit 954032d2527f2fce7355ba70709b5e143d6b686f upstream.

This was noticed by users who performed more than 2^32 lock operations
and hence made this counter overflow (eventually leading to
use-after-free's).  Setting rq_client to NULL here means that it won't
later get auth_domain_put() when it should be.

Appears to have been introduced in 2.5.42 by "[PATCH] kNFSd: Move auth
domain lookup into svcauth" which moved most of the rq_client handling
to common svcauth code, but left behind this one line.
