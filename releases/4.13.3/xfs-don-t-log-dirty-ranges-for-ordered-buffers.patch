Subject: xfs: don't log dirty ranges for ordered buffers
To: stable@vger.kernel.org

Message-ID: <20170917210631.10725-17-hch@lst.de>

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

commit 8dc518dfa7dbd079581269e51074b3c55a65a880 upstream.

Ordered buffers are attached to transactions and pushed through the
logging infrastructure just like normal buffers with the exception
that they are not actually written to the log. Therefore, we don't
need to log dirty ranges of ordered buffers. xfs_trans_log_buf() is
called on ordered buffers to set up all of the dirty state on the
transaction, buffer and log item and prepare the buffer for I/O.

Now that xfs_trans_dirty_buf() is available, call it from
xfs_trans_ordered_buf() so the latter is now mutually exclusive with
xfs_trans_log_buf(). This reflects the implementation of ordered
buffers and helps eliminate confusion over the need to log ranges of
ordered buffers just to set up internal log state.
