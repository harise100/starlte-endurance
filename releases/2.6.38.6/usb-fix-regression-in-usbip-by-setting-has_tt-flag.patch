Subject: USB: fix regression in usbip by setting has_tt flag

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

commit cee6a262550f53a13acfefbc1e3e5ff35c96182c upstream.

This patch (as1460) fixes a regression in the usbip driver caused by
the new check for Transaction Translators in USB-2 hubs.  The root hub
registered by vhci_hcd needs to have the has_tt flag set, because it
can connect to low- and full-speed devices as well as high-speed
devices.
