This event can be used to identify if the machine is truly front-end bound.  When this event occurs, it is an indication that the front-end of the machine is operating at less than its theoretical peak performance. Background: We can think of the processor pipeline as being divided into 2 broader parts: Front-end and Back-end. Front-end is responsible for fetching the instruction, decoding into uops in machine understandable format and putting them into a uop queue to be consumed by back end. The back-end then takes these uops, allocates the required resources.  When all resources are ready, uops are executed. If the back-end is not ready to accept uops from the front-end, then we do not want to count these as front-end bottlenecks.  However, whenever we have bottlenecks in the back-end, we will have allocation unit stalls and eventually forcing the front-end to wait until the back-end is ready to receive more uops. This event counts only when back-end is requesting more uops and front-end is not able to provide them. When 3 uops are requested and no uops are delivered, the event counts 3. When 3 are requested, and only 1 is delivered, the event counts 2. When only 2 are delivered, the event counts 1. Alternatively stated, the event will not count if 3 uops are delivered, or if the back end is stalled and not requesting any uops at all.  Counts indicate missed opportunities for the front-end to deliver a uop to the back end. Some examples of conditions that cause front-end efficiencies are: ICache misses, ITLB misses, and decoder restrictions that limit the front-end bandwidth. Known Issues: Some uops require multiple allocation slots.  These uops will not be charged as a front end 'not delivered' opportunity, and will be regarded as a back end problem. For example, the INC instruction has one uop that requires 2 issue slots.  A stream of INC instructions will not count as UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED, even though only one instruction can be issued per clock.  The low uop issue rate for a stream of INC instructions is considered to be a back end issue.",
