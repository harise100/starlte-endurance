Subject: mm: memcg: rework and document OOM waiting and wakeup

From: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>

commit fb2a6fc56be66c169f8b80e07ed999ba453a2db2 upstream.

The memcg OOM handler open-codes a sleeping lock for OOM serialization
(trylock, wait, repeat) because the required locking is so specific to
memcg hierarchies.  However, it would be nice if this construct would be
clearly recognizable and not be as obfuscated as it is right now.  Clean
up as follows:

1. Remove the return value of mem_cgroup_oom_unlock()

2. Rename mem_cgroup_oom_lock() to mem_cgroup_oom_trylock().

3. Pull the prepare_to_wait() out of the memcg_oom_lock scope.  This
   makes it more obvious that the task has to be on the waitqueue
   before attempting to OOM-trylock the hierarchy, to not miss any
   wakeups before going to sleep.  It just didn't matter until now
   because it was all lumped together into the global memcg_oom_lock
   spinlock section.

4. Pull the mem_cgroup_oom_notify() out of the memcg_oom_lock scope.
   It is proctected by the hierarchical OOM-lock.

5. The memcg_oom_lock spinlock is only required to propagate the OOM
   lock in any given hierarchy atomically.  Restrict its scope to
   mem_cgroup_oom_(trylock|unlock).

6. Do not wake up the waitqueue unconditionally at the end of the
   function.  Only the lockholder has to wake up the next in line
   after releasing the lock.

   Note that the lockholder kicks off the OOM-killer, which in turn
   leads to wakeups from the uncharges of the exiting task.  But a
   contender is not guaranteed to see them if it enters the OOM path
   after the OOM kills but before the lockholder releases the lock.
   Thus there has to be an explicit wakeup after releasing the lock.

7. Put the OOM task on the waitqueue before marking the hierarchy as
   under OOM as that is the point where we start to receive wakeups.
   No point in listening before being on the waitqueue.

8. Likewise, unmark the hierarchy before finishing the sleep, for
   symmetry.
