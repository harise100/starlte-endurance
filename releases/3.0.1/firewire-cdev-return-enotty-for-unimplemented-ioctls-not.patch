Subject: firewire: cdev: return -ENOTTY for unimplemented ioctls, not -EINVAL

So let's correct this in the <linux/firewire-cdev.h> ABI while it is
still young, relative to distributor adoption.

Side note:  We return -ENOTTY not only on _IOC_TYPE or _IOC_NR mismatch,
but also on _IOC_SIZE mismatch.  An ioctl with an unsupported size of
argument structure can be seen as an unsupported version of that ioctl.
