Subject: [SCSI] ses: requesting a fault indication

From: Douglas Gilbert <dgilbert@interlog.com>

commit 2a350cab9daf9a46322d83b091bb05cf54ccf6ab upstream.

Noticed that when the sysfs interface of the SCSI SES
driver was used to request a fault indication the LED
flashed but the buzzer didn't sound. So it was doing
what REQUEST IDENT (locate) should do.

Changelog:
   - fix the setting of REQUEST FAULT for the device slot
     and array device slot elements in the enclosure control
     diagnostic page
   - note the potentially defective code that reads the
     FAULT SENSED and FAULT REQUESTED bits from the enclosure
     status diagnostic page

The attached patch is against git/scsi-misc-2.6
