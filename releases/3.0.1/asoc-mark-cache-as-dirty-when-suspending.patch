Subject: ASoC: Mark cache as dirty when suspending

From: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

commit 7be4ba24a3ea53bc8ade841635e4d4a59e98ceb5 upstream.

Since quite a few drivers are not managing to flag the cache as needing
to be resynced after suspend and it's a reasonable thing to do flag the
cache as needing sync automatically when suspending.

The expectation is that systems will mainly only keep the CODEC powered
when doing audio through the CODEC so we won't actually suspend the
device anyway; drivers which want to can override this behaviour when
they resume.
