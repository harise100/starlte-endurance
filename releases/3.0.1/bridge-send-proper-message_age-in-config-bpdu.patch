Subject: bridge: send proper message_age in config BPDU

From: stephen hemminger <shemminger@vyatta.com>

commit 0c03150e7ea8f7fcd03cfef29385e0010b22ee92 upstream.

A bridge topology with three systems:

      +------+  +------+
      | A(2) |--| B(1) |
      +------+  +------+
           \    /
          +------+
          | C(3) |
          +------+

What is supposed to happen:
 * bridge with the lowest ID is elected root (for example: B)
 * C detects that A->C is higher cost path and puts in blocking state

What happens. Bridge with lowest id (B) is elected correctly as
root and things start out fine initially. But then config BPDU
doesn't get transmitted from A -> C. Because of that
the link from A-C is transistioned to the forwarding state.

The root cause of this is that the configuration messages
is generated with bogus message age, and dropped before
sending.

In the standardmessage_age is supposed to be:
  the time since the generation of the Configuration BPDU by
  the Root that instigated the generation of this Configuration BPDU.

Reimplement this by recording the timestamp (age + jiffies) when
recording config information. The old code incorrectly used the time
elapsed on the ageing timer which was incorrect.
