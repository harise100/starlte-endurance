Subject: mac80211: Restart STA timers only on associated state

From: Rajkumar Manoharan <rmanohar@qca.qualcomm.com>

commit 676b58c27475a9defccc025fea1cbd2b141ee539 upstream.

A panic was observed when the device is failed to resume properly,
and there are no running interfaces. ieee80211_reconfig tries
to restart STA timers on unassociated state.
