Subject: PCI: fix reference leak in pci_get_dev_by_id()
To: jejb@kernel.org, stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <200808252005.m7PK56en010112@hera.kernel.org>

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>

commit ebca4f1bce1eb7b91a63c515db66316db9391221 upstream

Alex Chiang and Matthew Wilcox pointed out that pci_get_dev_by_id() does
not properly decrement the reference on the from pointer if it is
present, like the documentation for the function states it will.

It fixes a pretty bad leak in the hotplug core (we were leaking an
entire struct pci_dev for each function of each offlined card, the first
time around; subsequent onlines/offlines were ok).
