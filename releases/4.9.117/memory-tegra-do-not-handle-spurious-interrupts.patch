Subject: memory: tegra: Do not handle spurious interrupts

From: Dmitry Osipenko <digetx@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit bf3fbdfbec947cdd04b2f2c4bce11534c8786eee ]

The ISR reads interrupts-enable mask, but doesn't utilize it. Apply the
mask to the interrupt status and don't handle interrupts that MC driver
haven't asked for. Kernel would disable spurious MC IRQ and report the
error. This would happen only in a case of a very severe bug.
