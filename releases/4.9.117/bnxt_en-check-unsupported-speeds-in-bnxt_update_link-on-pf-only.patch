Subject: bnxt_en: Check unsupported speeds in bnxt_update_link() on PF only.

From: Michael Chan <michael.chan@broadcom.com>

[ Upstream commit dac0490718bd17df5e3995ffca14255e5f9ed22d ]

Only non-NPAR PFs need to actively check and manage unsupported link
speeds.  NPAR functions and VFs do not control the link speed and
should skip the unsupported speed detection logic, to avoid warning
messages from firmware rejecting the unsupported firmware calls.
