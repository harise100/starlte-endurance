Subject: watchdog: sp5100_tco: Set the AcpiMmioSel bitmask value to 1 instead of 2

From: Takahisa Tanaka <mc74hc00@gmail.com>

commit 81fc933f176cd95f757bfc8a98109ef422598b79 upstream.

The AcpiMmioSel bit is bit 1 in the AcpiMmioEn register, but the current
sp5100_tco driver is using bit 2.

See 2.3.3 Power Management (PM) Registers page 150 of the
AMD SB800-Series Southbridges Register Reference Guide [1].

        AcpiMmioEn - RW â€“ 8/16/32 bits - [PM_Reg: 24h]
        Field Name        Bits  Default  Description
        AcpiMMioDecodeEn  0     0b       Set to 1 to enable AcpiMMio space.
        AcpiMMIoSel       1     0b       Set AcpiMMio registers to be memory-mapped or IO-mapped space.
                                         0: Memory-mapped space
                                         1: I/O-mapped space

The sp5100_tco driver expects zero as a value of AcpiMmioSel (bit 1).

Fortunately, no problems were caused by this typo, because the default
value of the undocumented misused bit 2 seems to be zero.

However, the sp5100_tco driver should use the correct bitmask value.
