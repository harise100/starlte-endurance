Subject: sound: Fix make allmodconfig on MIPS correctly

From: Paul Bolle <pebolle@tiscali.nl>

commit a62ee234a572b4c98fe98cf5fb18e4e8b0f6e43d upstream.

Commit d4702b189c ("sound: Fix make allmodconfig on MIPS") added a
(negative) dependency on ISA_DMA_SUPPORT_BROKEN. Since that Kconfig
symbol doesn't exist, this dependency will always evaluate to true.
Apparently GENERIC_ISA_DMA_SUPPORT_BROKEN was meant to be used here.
