Commit 64c634ef83991b390ec0503e61f16efb0ba3c60b upstream.

Camcorders have a tendency to fail read requests to their config ROM and
write request to their FCP command register with ack_busy_X.  This has
become a problem with newer kernels and especially Panasonic camcorders,
causing AV/C in dvgrab and kino to fail.  Dvgrab for example frequently
logs "send oops"; kino reports loss of AV/C control.  I suspect that
lower CPU scheduling latencies in newer kernels made this issue more
prominent now.

According to
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=114103&aid=2492640&group_id=14103
this can be fixed by configuring the FireWire controller for more
hardware retries for request transmission; these retries are evidently
more successful than libavc1394's own retry loop (typically 3 tries on
top of hardware retries).

Presumably the same issue has been reported at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=449252 and
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=477279 .
