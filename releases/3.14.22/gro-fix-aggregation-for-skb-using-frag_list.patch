Subject: gro: fix aggregation for skb using frag_list

From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 73d3fe6d1c6d840763ceafa9afae0aaafa18c4b5 ]

In commit 8a29111c7ca6 ("net: gro: allow to build full sized skb")
I added a regression for linear skb that traditionally force GRO
to use the frag_list fallback.

Erez Shitrit found that at most two segments were aggregated and
the "if (skb_gro_len(p) != pinfo->gso_size)" test was failing.

This is because pinfo at this spot still points to the last skb in the
chain, instead of the first one, where we find the correct gso_size
information.
