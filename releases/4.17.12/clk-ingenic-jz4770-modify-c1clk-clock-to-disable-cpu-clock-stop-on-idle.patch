Subject: clk: ingenic: jz4770: Modify C1CLK clock to disable CPU clock stop on idle

From: Paul Cercueil <paul@crapouillou.net>

[ Upstream commit 45ba63a29fd9b8a461110185e3abc5b4c90b806a ]

When the main processor goes idle, by default its clock is stopped.
However, this also stops the clock of the co-processor.

Here, if the C1CLK clock is enabled, we disable this functionality.
