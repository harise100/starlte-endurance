Subject: lib: radix-tree: add radix_tree_delete_item()

From: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>

commit 53c59f262d747ea82e7414774c59a489501186a0 upstream.

Provide a function that does not just delete an entry at a given index,
but also allows passing in an expected item.  Delete only if that item
is still located at the specified index.

This is handy when lockless tree traversals want to delete entries as
well because they don't have to do an second, locked lookup to verify
the slot has not changed under them before deleting the entry.
