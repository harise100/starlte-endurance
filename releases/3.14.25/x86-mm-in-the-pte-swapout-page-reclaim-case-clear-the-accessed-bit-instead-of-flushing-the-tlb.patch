Subject: x86/mm: In the PTE swapout page reclaim case clear the accessed bit instead of flushing the TLB

From: Shaohua Li <shli@kernel.org>

commit b13b1d2d8692b437203de7a404c6b809d2cc4d99 upstream.

We use the accessed bit to age a page at page reclaim time,
and currently we also flush the TLB when doing so.

But in some workloads TLB flush overhead is very heavy. In my
simple multithreaded app with a lot of swap to several pcie
SSDs, removing the tlb flush gives about 20% ~ 30% swapout
speedup.

Fortunately just removing the TLB flush is a valid optimization:
on x86 CPUs, clearing the accessed bit without a TLB flush
doesn't cause data corruption.

It could cause incorrect page aging and the (mistaken) reclaim of
hot pages, but the chance of that should be relatively low.

So as a performance optimization don't flush the TLB when
clearing the accessed bit, it will eventually be flushed by
a context switch or a VM operation anyway. [ In the rare
event of it not getting flushed for a long time the delay
shouldn't really matter because there's no real memory
pressure for swapout to react to. ]
