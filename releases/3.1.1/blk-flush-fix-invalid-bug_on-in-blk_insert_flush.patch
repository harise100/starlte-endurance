Subject: blk-flush: fix invalid BUG_ON in blk_insert_flush

From: Jeff Moyer <jmoyer@redhat.com>

commit 834f9f61a525d2f6d3d0c93894e26326c8d3ceed upstream.

A user reported a regression due to commit
4853abaae7e4a2af938115ce9071ef8684fb7af4 (block: fix flush
machinery for stacking drivers with differring flush flags).
Part of the problem is that blk_insert_flush required a
single bio be attached to the request.  In reality, having
no attached bio is also a valid case, as can be observed with
an empty flush.
