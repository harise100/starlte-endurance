Subject: drm/i915/tv: Remember the detected TV type

From: Mathew McKernan <matmckernan@rauland.com.au>

commit d5627663f2088fa4be447fdcfd52bcb233448d85 upstream.

During detect() we would probe the connection bits to determine if
there was a TV attached, and what video input type (Component, S-Video,
Composite, etc) to use. However, we promptly discarded this vital bit of
information and never propagated it to where it was used to determine
the correct modes and setup the control registers. Fix it!

This fixes a regression from 7b334fcb45b757ffb093696ca3de1b0c8b4a33f1.
