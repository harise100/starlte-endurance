Subject: tty/n_gsm: fix bug in CRC calculation for gsm1 mode

From: Mikhail Kshevetskiy <mikhail.kshevetskiy@gmail.com>

commit 9db4e4381a8e881ff65a5d3400bfa471f84217e7 upstream.

Problem description:
  gsm_queue() calculate a CRC for arrived frames. As a last step of
  CRC calculation it call

    gsm->fcs = gsm_fcs_add(gsm->fcs, gsm->received_fcs);

  This work perfectly for the case of GSM0 mode as gsm->received_fcs
  contain the last piece of data required to generate final CRC.

  gsm->received_fcs is not used for GSM1 mode. Thus we put an
  additional byte to CRC calculation. As result we get a wrong CRC
  and reject incoming frame.
