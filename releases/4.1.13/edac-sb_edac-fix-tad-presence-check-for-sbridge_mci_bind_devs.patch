Subject: EDAC, sb_edac: Fix TAD presence check for sbridge_mci_bind_devs()

From: Seth Jennings <sjenning@redhat.com>

commit 2900ea609616c2651dec65312beeb2a6e536bc50 upstream.

In commit

  7d375bffa524 ("sb_edac: Fix support for systems with two home agents per socket")

NUM_CHANNELS was changed to 8 and the channel space was renumerated to
handle EN, EP, and EX configurations.

The *_mci_bind_devs() functions - except for sbridge_mci_bind_devs() -
got a new device presence check in the form of saw_chan_mask. However,
sbridge_mci_bind_devs() still uses the NUM_CHANNELS for loop.

With the increase in NUM_CHANNELS, this loop fails at index 4 since
SB only has 4 TADs.  This results in the following error on SB machines:

  EDAC sbridge: Some needed devices are missing
  EDAC sbridge: Couldn't find mci handler
  EDAC sbridge: Couldn't find mci handle

This patch adapts the saw_chan_mask logic for sbridge_mci_bind_devs() as
well.

After this patch:

  EDAC MC0: Giving out device to module sbridge_edac.c controller Sandy Bridge Socket#0: DEV 0000:3f:0e.0 (POLLED)
  EDAC MC1: Giving out device to module sbridge_edac.c controller Sandy Bridge Socket#1: DEV 0000:7f:0e.0 (POLLED)
