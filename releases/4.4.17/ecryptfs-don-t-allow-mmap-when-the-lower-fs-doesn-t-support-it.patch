Subject: ecryptfs: don't allow mmap when the lower fs doesn't support it

From: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>

commit f0fe970df3838c202ef6c07a4c2b36838ef0a88b upstream.

There are legitimate reasons to disallow mmap on certain files, notably
in sysfs or procfs.  We shouldn't emulate mmap support on file systems
that don't offer support natively.

CVE-2016-1583
