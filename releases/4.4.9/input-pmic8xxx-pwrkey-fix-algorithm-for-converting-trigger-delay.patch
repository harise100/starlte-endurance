Subject: Input: pmic8xxx-pwrkey - fix algorithm for converting trigger delay

From: Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>

commit eda5ecc0a6b865561997e177c393f0b0136fe3b7 upstream.

The trigger delay algorithm that converts from microseconds to
the register value looks incorrect. According to most of the PMIC
documentation, the equation is

	delay (Seconds) = (1 / 1024) * 2 ^ (x + 4)

except for one case where the documentation looks to have a
formatting issue and the equation looks like

	delay (Seconds) = (1 / 1024) * 2 x + 4

Most likely this driver was written with the improper
documentation to begin with. According to the downstream sources
the valid delays are from 2 seconds to 1/64 second, and the
latter equation just doesn't make sense for that. Let's fix the
algorithm and the range check to match the documentation and the
downstream sources.
