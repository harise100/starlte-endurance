Subject: stmmac: reset last TSO segment size after device open

From: Lars Persson <lars.persson@axis.com>


[ Upstream commit 45ab4b13e46325d00f4acdb365d406e941a15f81 ]

The mss variable tracks the last max segment size sent to the TSO
engine. We do not update the hardware as long as we receive skb:s with
the same value in gso_size.

During a network device down/up cycle (mapped to stmmac_release() and
stmmac_open() callbacks) we issue a reset to the hardware and it
forgets the setting for mss. However we did not zero out our mss
variable so the next transmission of a gso packet happens with an
undefined hardware setting.

This triggers a hang in the TSO engine and eventuelly the netdev
watchdog will bark.
