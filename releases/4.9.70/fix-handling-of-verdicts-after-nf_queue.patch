[This fix is only needed for v4.9 stable since v4.10+ does not have the issue]

A verdict of NF_STOLEN after NF_QUEUE will cause an incorrect return value
and a potential kernel panic via double free of skb's

This was broken by commit 7034b566a4e7 ("netfilter: fix nf_queue handling")
and subsequently fixed in v4.10 by commit c63cbc460419 ("netfilter:
use switch() to handle verdict cases from nf_hook_slow()"). However that
commit cannot be cleanly cherry-picked to v4.9
