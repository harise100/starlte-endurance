Subject: rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix 5G failure when EEPROM is incorrectly encoded

From: Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>

commit c72fc9093718a3f8597249863a1bac345ba00859 upstream.

Recently, it has been reported that D-Link DWA-582 cards, which use an
RTL8812AE chip are not able to scan for 5G networks. The problems started
with kernel 4.2, which is the first version that had commit d10101a60372
("rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix problem with regulatory information"). With this
patch, the driver went from setting a default channel plan to using
the value derived from EEPROM.

Bug reports at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111031 and
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1279653 are examples of this
problem.

The problem was solved once I learned that the internal country code was
resulting in a regulatory set with only 2.4 GHz channels. With the RTL8821AE
chips available to me, the country code was such that both 2.4 and 5 GHz
channels are allowed. The fix is to allow both bands even when the EEPROM
is incorrectly encoded.
