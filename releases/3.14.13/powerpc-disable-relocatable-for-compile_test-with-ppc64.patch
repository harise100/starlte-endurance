Subject: powerpc: Disable RELOCATABLE for COMPILE_TEST with PPC64

From: Guenter Roeck <linux@roeck-us.net>

commit fb43e8477ed9006c4f397f904c691a120503038c upstream.

powerpc:allmodconfig has been failing for some time with the following
error.

arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S: Assembler messages:
arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S:1312: Error: attempt to move .org backwards
make[1]: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel/head_64.o] Error 1

A number of attempts to fix the problem by moving around code have been
unsuccessful and resulted in failed builds for some configurations and
the discovery of toolchain bugs.

Fix the problem by disabling RELOCATABLE for COMPILE_TEST builds instead.
While this is less than perfect, it avoids substantial code changes
which would otherwise be necessary just to make COMPILE_TEST builds
happy and might have undesired side effects.
