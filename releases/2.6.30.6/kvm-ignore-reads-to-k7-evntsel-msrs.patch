(cherry picked from commit 9e6996240afcbe61682eab8eeaeb65c34333164d)

In commit 7fe29e0faacb650d31b9e9f538203a157bec821d we ignored the
reads to the P6 EVNTSEL MSRs. That fixed crashes on Intel machines.

Ignore the reads to K7 EVNTSEL MSRs as well to fix this on AMD
hosts.

This fixes Kaspersky antivirus crashing Windows guests on AMD hosts.
