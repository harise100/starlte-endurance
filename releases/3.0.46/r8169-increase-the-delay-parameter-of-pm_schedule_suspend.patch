Subject: r8169: increase the delay parameter of pm_schedule_suspend
To: stable@vger.kernel.org


From: hayeswang <hayeswang@realtek.com>

commit 10953db8e1a278742ef7e64a3d1491802bcfa98b upstream
The link down would occur when reseting PHY. And it would take about 2 ~ 5
seconds from link down to link up. If the delay of pm_schedule_suspend is
not long enough, the device would enter runtime_suspend before link up.
After link up, the device would wake up and reset PHY again. Then, you
would find the driver keep in a loop of runtime_suspend and rumtime_resume.
