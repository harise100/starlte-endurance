Subject: PM: Prevent waiting forever on asynchronous resume after failing suspend

From: Colin Cross <ccross@android.com>

commit 152e1d592071c8b312bb898bc1118b64e4aea535 upstream.

During suspend, the power.completion is expected to be set when a
device has not yet started suspending.  Set it on init to fix a
corner case where a device is resumed when its parent has never
suspended.

Consider three drivers, A, B, and C.  The parent of A is C, and C
has async_suspend set.  On boot, C->power.completion is initialized
to 0.

During the first suspend:
suspend_devices_and_enter(...)
 dpm_resume(...)
  device_suspend(A)
  device_suspend(B) returns error, aborts suspend
 dpm_resume_end(...)
   dpm_resume(...)
    device_resume(A)
     dpm_wait(A->parent == C)
      wait_for_completion(C->power.completion)

The wait_for_completion will never complete, because
complete_all(C->power.completion) will only be called from
device_suspend(C) or device_resume(C), neither of which is called
if suspend is aborted before C.

After a successful suspend->resume cycle, where B doesn't abort
suspend, C->power.completion is left in the completed state by the
call to device_resume(C), and the same call path will work if B
aborts suspend.
