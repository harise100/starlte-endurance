Subject: bonding: correctly process non-linear skbs

From: Andy Gospodarek <andy@greyhouse.net>

commit ab12811c89e88f2e66746790b1fe4469ccb7bdd9 upstream.

It was recently brought to my attention that 802.3ad mode bonds would no
longer form when using some network hardware after a driver update.
After snooping around I realized that the particular hardware was using
page-based skbs and found that skb->data did not contain a valid LACPDU
as it was not stored there.  That explained the inability to form an
802.3ad-based bond.  For balance-alb mode bonds this was also an issue
as ARPs would not be properly processed.

This patch fixes the issue in my tests and should be applied to 2.6.36
and as far back as anyone cares to add it to stable.

Thanks to Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@intel.com> and Jesse
Brandeburg <jesse.brandeburg@intel.com> for the suggestions on this one.
