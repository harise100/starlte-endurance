Subject: virtio: console: Prevent userspace from submitting NULL buffers

From: Amit Shah <amit.shah@redhat.com>

commit 65745422a898741ee0e7068ef06624ab06e8aefa upstream.

A userspace could submit a buffer with 0 length to be written to the
host.  Prevent such a situation.

This was not needed previously, but recent changes in the way write()
works exposed this condition to trigger a virtqueue event to the host,
causing a NULL buffer to be sent across.
