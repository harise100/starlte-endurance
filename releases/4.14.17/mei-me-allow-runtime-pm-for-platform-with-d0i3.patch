Subject: mei: me: allow runtime pm for platform with D0i3

From: Tomas Winkler <tomas.winkler@intel.com>

commit cc365dcf0e56271bedf3de95f88922abe248e951 upstream.

>From the pci power documentation:
"The driver itself should not call pm_runtime_allow(), though. Instead,
it should let user space or some platform-specific code do that (user space
can do it via sysfs as stated above)..."

However, the S0ix residency cannot be reached without MEI device getting
into low power state. Hence, for mei devices that support D0i3, it's better
to make runtime power management mandatory and not rely on the system
integration such as udev rules.
This policy cannot be applied globally as some older platforms
were found to have broken power management.
