Subject: scsi: aacraid: Fix hang in kdump

From: Raghava Aditya Renukunta <RaghavaAditya.Renukunta@microsemi.com>

commit c5313ae8e4e037bfaf5e56cb8d6efdb8e92ce437 upstream.

Driver attempts to perform a device scan and device add after coming out
of reset. At times when the kdump kernel loads and it tries to perform
eh recovery, the device scan hangs since its commands are blocked because
of the eh recovery. This should have shown up in normal eh recovery path
(Should have been obvious)

Remove the code that performs scanning.I can live without the rescanning
support in the stable kernels but a hanging kdump/eh recovery needs to be
fixed.
