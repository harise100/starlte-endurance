Subject: mac80211: minstrel, fix memory corruption

From: Jiri Slaby <jirislaby@gmail.com>

commit 8e532175277d9a5eae49768ed086555081f741a7 upstream.

minstrel doesn't count max rate count in fact, since it doesn't use
a loop variable `i' and hence allocs space only for bitrates found in
the first band.

Fix it by involving the `i' as an index so that it traverses all the
bands now and finds the real max bitrate count.
