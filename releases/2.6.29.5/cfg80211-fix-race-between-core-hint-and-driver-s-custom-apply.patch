Subject: cfg80211: fix race between core hint and driver's custom apply

From: Luis R. Rodriguez <lrodriguez@atheros.com>

commit 5078b2e32ad4b1f753b1c837c15892202f753c97 upstream.

Its possible for cfg80211 to have scheduled the work and for
the global workqueue to not have kicked in prior to a cfg80211
driver's regulatory hint or wiphy_apply_custom_regulatory().

Although this is very unlikely its possible and should fix
this race. When this race would happen you are expected to have
hit a null pointer dereference panic.
