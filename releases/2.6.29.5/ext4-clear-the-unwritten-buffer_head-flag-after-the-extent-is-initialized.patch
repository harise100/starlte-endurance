(cherry picked from commit 2a8964d63d50dd2d65d71d342bc7fb6ef4117614)

The BH_Unwritten flag indicates that the buffer is allocated on disk
but has not been written; that is, the disk was part of a persistent
preallocation area.  That flag should only be set when a get_blocks()
function is looking up a inode's logical to physical block mapping.

When ext4_get_blocks_wrap() is called with create=1, the uninitialized
extent is converted into an initialized one, so the BH_Unwritten flag
is no longer appropriate.  Hence, we need to make sure the
BH_Unwritten is not left set, since the combination of BH_Mapped and
BH_Unwritten is not allowed; among other things, it will result ext4's
get_block() to be called over and over again during the write_begin
phase of write(2).
