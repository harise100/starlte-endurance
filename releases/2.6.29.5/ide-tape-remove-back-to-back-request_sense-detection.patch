Subject: ide-tape: remove back-to-back REQUEST_SENSE detection

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit 36999a5af1b6c5379e59f0ddf434db08d03c19e4 upstream.

Impact: fix an oops which always triggers

ide_tape_issue_pc() assumed drive->pc isn't NULL on invocation when
checking for back-to-back request sense issues but drive->pc can be
NULL and even when it's not NULL, it's not safe to dereference it once
the previous command is complete because pc could have been freed or
was on stack.  Kill back-to-back REQUEST_SENSE detection.
