Subject: ALSA: line6: Fix leftover URB at error-path during probe

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit c95072b3d88fac4be295815f2b67df366c0c297f upstream.

While line6_probe() may kick off URB for a control MIDI endpoint, the
function doesn't clean up it properly at its error path.  This results
in a leftover URB action that is eventually triggered later and causes
an Oops like:
  general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN
  CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted
  RIP: 0010:usb_fill_bulk_urb ./include/linux/usb.h:1619

   call_timer_fn+0x2a2/0x940 kernel/time/timer.c:1281
   ....

Since the whole clean-up procedure is done in line6_disconnect()
callback, we can simply call it in the error path instead of
open-coding the whole again.  It'll fix such an issue automagically.

The bug was spotted by syzkaller.
