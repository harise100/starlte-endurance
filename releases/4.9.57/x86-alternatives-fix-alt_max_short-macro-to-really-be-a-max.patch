Subject: x86/alternatives: Fix alt_max_short macro to really be a max()

From: Mathias Krause <minipli@googlemail.com>

commit 6b32c126d33d5cb379bca280ab8acedc1ca978ff upstream.

The alt_max_short() macro in asm/alternative.h does not work as
intended, leading to nasty bugs. E.g. alt_max_short("1", "3")
evaluates to 3, but alt_max_short("3", "1") evaluates to 1 -- not
exactly the maximum of 1 and 3.

In fact, I had to learn it the hard way by crashing my kernel in not
so funny ways by attempting to make use of the ALTENATIVE_2 macro
with alternatives where the first one was larger than the second
one.

According to [1] and commit dbe4058a6a44 ("x86/alternatives: Fix
ALTERNATIVE_2 padding generation properly") the right handed side
should read "-(-(a < b))" not "-(-(a - b))". Fix that, to make the
macro work as intended.

While at it, fix up the comments regarding the additional "-", too.
It's not about gas' usage of s32 but brain dead logic of having a
"true" value of -1 for the < operator ... *sigh*

Btw., the one in asm/alternative-asm.h is correct. And, apparently,
all current users of ALTERNATIVE_2() pass same sized alternatives,
avoiding to hit the bug.
