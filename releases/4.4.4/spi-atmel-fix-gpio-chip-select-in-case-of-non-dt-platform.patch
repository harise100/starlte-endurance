Subject: spi: atmel: fix gpio chip-select in case of non-DT platform

From: Cyrille Pitchen <cyrille.pitchen@atmel.com>

commit 70f340df24518d36eeaefb6652d492f250115c19 upstream.

The non-DT platform that uses this driver (actually the AVR32) was taking a bad
branch for determining if the IP would use gpio for CS.
Adding the presence of DT as a condition fixes this issue.

Fixes: 4820303480a1 ("spi: atmel: add support for the internal chip-select of the spi controller")
