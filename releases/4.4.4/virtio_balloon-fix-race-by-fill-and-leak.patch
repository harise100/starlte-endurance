Subject: virtio_balloon: fix race by fill and leak

From: Minchan Kim <minchan@kernel.org>

commit f68b992bbb474641881932c61c92dcfa6f5b3689 upstream.

During my compaction-related stuff, I encountered a bug
with ballooning.

With repeated inflating and deflating cycle, guest memory(
ie, cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemTotal) is decreased and
couldn't be recovered.

The reason is balloon_lock doesn't cover release_pages_balloon
so struct virtio_balloon fields could be overwritten by race
of fill_balloon(e,g, vb->*pfns could be critical).

This patch fixes it in my test.
