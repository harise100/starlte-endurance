Subject: iwlwifi: mvm: don't allow sched scans without matches to be started

From: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>

commit 5e56276e7555b34550d51459a801ff75eca8b907 upstream.

The firmware can perform a scheduled scan with not matchsets passed,
but it can't send notification that results were found.  Since the
userspace then cannot know when we got new results and the firmware
wouldn't trigger a wake in case we are sleeping, it's better not to
allow scans without matchsets.

This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110831
