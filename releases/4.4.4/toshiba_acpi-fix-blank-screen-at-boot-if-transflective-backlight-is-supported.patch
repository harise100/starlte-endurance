Subject: toshiba_acpi: Fix blank screen at boot if transflective backlight is supported

From: Azael Avalos <coproscefalo@gmail.com>

commit bae5336f0aaedffa115dab9cb3d8a4e4aed3a26a upstream.

If transflective backlight is supported and the brightness is zero
(lowest brightness level), the set_lcd_brightness function will activate
the transflective backlight, making the LCD appear to be turned off.

This patch fixes the issue by incrementing the brightness level, and
by doing so, avoiding the activation of the tranflective backlight.
