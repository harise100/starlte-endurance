Subject: Revert "pinctrl: msm: Use dynamic GPIO numbering"

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

This reverts commit 7d8e0341b2b93fb505cd75e8e0d4f1911d0fa0fe which is
commit a7aa75a2a7dba32594291a71c3704000a2fd7089 upstream.

There's been too many complaints about this.  Personally I think it's
going to blow up when people hit this in mainline, but hey, it's not my
systems.  At least we don't have to backport the mess to the stable
kernels to give them some more life to live unscathed :)
