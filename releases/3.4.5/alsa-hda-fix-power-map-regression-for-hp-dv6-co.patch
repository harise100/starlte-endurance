Subject: ALSA: hda - Fix power-map regression for HP dv6 & co

commit 6e1c39c6b00d9141a82c231ba7c5e5b1716974b2 upstream.

The recent fix for power-map controls (commit b0791dda813) caused
regressions on some other HP laptops.  They have fixed pins but these
pins are exposed as jack-detectable.  Thus the driver tries to control
the power-map dynamically per jack detection where it never gets on.

This patch corrects the condition check for fixed pins so that the
power-map is set always for these pins.

NOTE: this is no simple backport from 3.5 kernel.  Since 3.5 kernel
had significant code change in the relevant part, I fixed this
differently.
