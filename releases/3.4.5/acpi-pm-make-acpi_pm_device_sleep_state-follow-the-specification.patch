Subject: ACPI / PM: Make acpi_pm_device_sleep_state() follow the specification

From: "Rafael J. Wysocki" <rjw@sisk.pl>

commit dbe9a2edd17d843d80faf2b99f20a691c1853418 upstream.

The comparison between the system sleep state being entered
and the lowest system sleep state the given device may wake up
from in acpi_pm_device_sleep_state() is reversed, because the
specification (ACPI 5.0) says that for wakeup to work:

"The sleeping state being entered must be less than or equal to the
 power state declared in element 1 of the _PRW object."

In other words, the state returned by _PRW is the deepest
(lowest-power) system sleep state the device is capable of waking up
the system from.

Moreover, acpi_pm_device_sleep_state() also should check if the
wakeup capability is supported through ACPI, because in principle it
may be done via native PCIe PME, for example, in which case _SxW
should not be evaluated.
