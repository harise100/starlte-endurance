Subject: stable_kernel_rules: reorganize and update submission options

From: Brian Norris <computersforpeace@gmail.com>

commit 5de61e7aa1ba9ac3c7edbea375da2bc8eb1a89ae upstream.

The current organization of Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt
doesn't clearly differentiate the mutually exclusive options for
submission to the -stable review process. As I understand it, patches
are not actually required to be mailed directly to
stable@vger.kernel.org, but the instructions do not make this clear.

Also, there are some established processes that are not listed --
specifically, what I call Option 2 below.

This patch updates and reorganizes a bit, to make things clearer.

+Option 1 is probably the easiest and most common. Options 2 and 3 are more
+useful if the patch isn't deemed worthy at the time it is applied to a public
+git tree (for instance, because it deserves more regression testing first).
+Option 3 is especially useful if the patch needs some special handling to apply
+to an older kernel (e.g., if API's have changed in the meantime).

+Additionally, some patches submitted via Option 1 may have additional patch
+prerequisites which can be cherry-picked. This can be specified in the following
