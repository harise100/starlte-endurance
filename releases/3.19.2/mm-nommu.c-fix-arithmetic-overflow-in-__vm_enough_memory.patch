Subject: mm/nommu.c: fix arithmetic overflow in __vm_enough_memory()

From: Roman Gushchin <klamm@yandex-team.ru>

commit 8138a67a5557ffea3a21dfd6f037842d4e748513 upstream.

I noticed that "allowed" can easily overflow by falling below 0, because
(total_vm / 32) can be larger than "allowed".  The problem occurs in
OVERCOMMIT_NONE mode.

In this case, a huge allocation can success and overcommit the system
(despite OVERCOMMIT_NONE mode).  All subsequent allocations will fall
(system-wide), so system become unusable.

The problem was masked out by commit c9b1d0981fcc
("mm: limit growth of 3% hardcoded other user reserve"),
but it's easy to reproduce it on older kernels:
1) set overcommit_memory sysctl to 2
2) mmap() large file multiple times (with VM_SHARED flag)
3) try to malloc() large amount of memory

It also can be reproduced on newer kernels, but miss-configured
sysctl_user_reserve_kbytes is required.

Fix this issue by switching to signed arithmetic here.
