Subject: drm/atomic: fix out of bounds read in for_each_*_in_state helpers

From: Andrey Ryabinin <a.ryabinin@samsung.com>

commit 60f207a5b6d8f23c2e8388b415e8d5c7311cc79d upstream.

for_each_*_in_state validate array index after
access to array elements, thus perform out of bounds read.

Fix this by validating index in the first place and read
array element iff validation was successful.

Fixes: df63b9994eaf ("drm/atomic: Add for_each_{connector,crtc,plane}_in_state helper macros")
