Subject: Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after append write

From: Filipe Manana <fdmanana@suse.com>

commit e4545de5b035c7debb73d260c78377dbb69cbfb5 upstream.

If we do an append write to a file (which increases its inode's i_size)
that does not have the flag BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC set in its inode,
and the previous transaction added a new hard link to the file, which sets
the flag BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING in the file's inode, and then fsync
the file, the inode's new i_size isn't logged. This has the consequence
that after the fsync log is replayed, the file size remains what it was
before the append write operation, which means users/applications will
not be able to read the data that was successsfully fsync'ed before.

This happens because neither the inode item nor the delayed inode get
their i_size updated when the append write is made - doing so would
require starting a transaction in the buffered write path, something that
we do not do intentionally for performance reasons.

Fix this by making sure that when the flag BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING is
set the inode is logged with its current i_size (log the in-memory inode
into the log tree).

This issue is not a recent regression and is easy to reproduce with the
following test case for fstests:

  seq=`basename $0`
  seqres=$RESULT_DIR/$seq
  echo "QA output created by $seq"

  here=`pwd`
  tmp=/tmp/$$
  status=1	# failure is the default!

  _cleanup()
  {
          _cleanup_flakey
          rm -f $tmp.*
  }
  trap "_cleanup; exit \$status" 0 1 2 3 15

  # get standard environment, filters and checks
  . ./common/rc
  . ./common/filter
  . ./common/dmflakey

  # real QA test starts here
  _supported_fs generic
  _supported_os Linux
  _need_to_be_root
  _require_scratch
  _require_dm_flakey
  _require_metadata_journaling $SCRATCH_DEV

  _crash_and_mount()
  {
          # Simulate a crash/power loss.
          _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_DROP_WRITES
          _unmount_flakey
          # Allow writes again and mount. This makes the fs replay its fsync log.
          _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_ALLOW_WRITES
          _mount_flakey
  }

  rm -f $seqres.full

  _scratch_mkfs >> $seqres.full 2>&1
  _init_flakey
  _mount_flakey

  # Create the test file with some initial data and then fsync it.
  # The fsync here is only needed to trigger the issue in btrfs, as it causes the
  # the flag BTRFS_INODE_NEEDS_FULL_SYNC to be removed from the btrfs inode.
  $XFS_IO_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa 0 32k" \
                  -c "fsync" \
                  $SCRATCH_MNT/foo | _filter_xfs_io
  sync

  # Add a hard link to our file.
  # On btrfs this sets the flag BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING on the btrfs inode,
  # which is a necessary condition to trigger the issue.
  ln $SCRATCH_MNT/foo $SCRATCH_MNT/bar

  # Sync the filesystem to force a commit of the current btrfs transaction, this
  # is a necessary condition to trigger the bug on btrfs.
  sync

  # Now append more data to our file, increasing its size, and fsync the file.
  # In btrfs because the inode flag BTRFS_INODE_COPY_EVERYTHING was set and the
  # write path did not update the inode item in the btree nor the delayed inode
  # item (in memory struture) in the current transaction (created by the fsync
  # handler), the fsync did not record the inode's new i_size in the fsync
  # log/journal. This made the data unavailable after the fsync log/journal is
  # replayed.
  $XFS_IO_PROG -c "pwrite -S 0xbb 32K 32K" \
               -c "fsync" \
               $SCRATCH_MNT/foo | _filter_xfs_io

  echo "File content after fsync and before crash:"
  od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo

  _crash_and_mount

  echo "File content after crash and log replay:"
  od -t x1 $SCRATCH_MNT/foo

  status=0
  exit

The expected file output before and after the crash/power failure expects the
appended data to be available, which is:

  0000000 aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa aa

  0100000 bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb bb
