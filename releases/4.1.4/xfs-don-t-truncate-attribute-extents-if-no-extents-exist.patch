Subject: xfs: don't truncate attribute extents if no extents exist

From: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>

commit f66bf042693b620133d39af8d2f13615f03eadfc upstream.

The xfs_attr3_root_inactive() call from xfs_attr_inactive() assumes that
attribute blocks exist to invalidate. It is possible to have an
attribute fork without extents, however. Consider the case where the
attribute fork is created towards the beginning of xfs_attr_set() but
some part of the subsequent attribute set fails.

If an inode in such a state hits xfs_attr_inactive(), it eventually
calls xfs_dabuf_map() and possibly xfs_bmapi_read(). The former emits a
filesystem corruption warning, returns an error that bubbles back up to
xfs_attr_inactive(), and leads to destruction of the in-core attribute
fork without an on-disk reset. If the inode happens to make it back
through xfs_inactive() in this state (e.g., via a concurrent bulkstat
that cycles the inode from the reclaim state and releases it), i_afp
might not exist when xfs_bmapi_read() is called and causes a NULL
dereference panic.

A '-p 2' fsstress run to ENOSPC on a relatively small fs (1GB)
reproduces these problems. The behavior is a regression caused by:

6dfe5a0 xfs: xfs_attr_inactive leaves inconsistent attr fork state behind

... which removed logic that avoided the attribute extent truncate when
no extents exist. Restore this logic to ensure the attribute fork is
destroyed and reset correctly if it exists without any allocated
extents.
