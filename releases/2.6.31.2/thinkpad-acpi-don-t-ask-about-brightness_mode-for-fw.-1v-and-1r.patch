Subject: thinkpad-acpi: don't ask about brightness_mode for fw. 1V and 1R

From: Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@hmh.eng.br>

commit 6da25bf51689a5cc60370d30275dbb9e6852e0cb upstream.

X40 (firmware 1V) and T41 (firmware 1R) have been confirmed to work
well with the new defaults, so we can stop pestering people to confirm
that fact.

For now, whitelist just these two firmware types.  It is best to have
at least one more firmware type confirmed for Radeon 9xxx and Intel
GMA-2 ThinkPads before removing the confirmation requests entirely.
