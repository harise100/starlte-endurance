Subject: [ARM] pxa/sharpsl_pm: zaurus c3000 aka spitz: fix resume

From: Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>

commit 99f329a2ba3c2d07cc90ca9309babf27ddf98bff upstream.

sharpsl_pm.c code tries to read battery state very early during
resume, but those battery meters are connected on SPI and that's only
resumed way later.

Replace the check with simple checking of battery fatal signal, that
actually works at this stage.
