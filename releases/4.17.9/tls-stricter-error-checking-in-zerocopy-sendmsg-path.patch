Subject: tls: Stricter error checking in zerocopy sendmsg path

From: Dave Watson <davejwatson@fb.com>

commit 32da12216e467dea70a09cd7094c30779ce0f9db upstream.

In the zerocopy sendmsg() path, there are error checks to revert
the zerocopy if we get any error code.  syzkaller has discovered
that tls_push_record can return -ECONNRESET, which is fatal, and
happens after the point at which it is safe to revert the iter,
as we've already passed the memory to do_tcp_sendpages.

Previously this code could return -ENOMEM and we would want to
revert the iter, but AFAIK this no longer returns ENOMEM after
a447da7d004 ("tls: fix waitall behavior in tls_sw_recvmsg"),
so we fail for all error codes.
