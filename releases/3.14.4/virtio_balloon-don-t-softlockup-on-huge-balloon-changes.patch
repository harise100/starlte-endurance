Subject: virtio_balloon: don't softlockup on huge balloon changes.

From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>

commit 1f74ef0f2d7d692fcd615621e0e734c3e7771413 upstream.

When adding or removing 100G from a balloon:

    BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [vballoon:367]

We have a wait_event_interruptible(), but the condition is always true
(more ballooning to do) so we don't ever sleep.  We also have a
wait_event() for the host to ack, but that is also always true as QEMU
is synchronous for balloon operations.
