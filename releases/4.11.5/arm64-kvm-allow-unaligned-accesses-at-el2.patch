Subject: arm64: KVM: Allow unaligned accesses at EL2

From: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>

commit 78fd6dcf11468a5a131b8365580d0c613bcc02cb upstream.

We currently have the SCTLR_EL2.A bit set, trapping unaligned accesses
at EL2, but we're not really prepared to deal with it. So far, this
has been unnoticed, until GCC 7 started emitting those (in particular
64bit writes on a 32bit boundary).

Since the rest of the kernel is pretty happy about that, let's follow
its example and set SCTLR_EL2.A to zero. Modern CPUs don't really
care.
