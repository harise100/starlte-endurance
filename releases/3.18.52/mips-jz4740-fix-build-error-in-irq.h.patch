kernelci found build error on the 3.18 stable tree that don't
show up in later versions:

The problem seems to be caused by commit 83bc76920080 ("MIPS: JZ4740: Use
generic irq chip") from linux-3.2, but only showed up in a defconfig
build when qi_lb60_defconfig was added in linux-3.13 and that configuration
never successfully built.

The code has changed in a number of ways before 4.4, which builds fine.
While I did not bisect the problem to a specific change, I found a simple
fix by including the obviously missing header.
