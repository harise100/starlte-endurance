Subject: m68k: Define asmlinkage_protect

From: Andreas Schwab <schwab@linux-m68k.org>

commit 8474ba74193d302e8340dddd1e16c85cc4b98caf upstream.

Make sure the compiler does not modify arguments of syscall functions.
This can happen if the compiler generates a tailcall to another
function.  For example, without asmlinkage_protect sys_openat is compiled
into this function:

sys_openat:
	clr.l %d0
	move.w 18(%sp),%d0
	move.l %d0,16(%sp)
	jbra do_sys_open

Note how the fourth argument is modified in place, modifying the register
%d4 that gets restored from this stack slot when the function returns to
user-space.  The caller may expect the register to be unmodified across
system calls.
