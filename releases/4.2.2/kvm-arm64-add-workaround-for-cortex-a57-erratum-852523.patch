Subject: KVM: arm64: add workaround for Cortex-A57 erratum #852523

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

commit 43297dda0a51e4ffed0888ce727c218cfb7474b6 upstream.

When restoring the system register state for an AArch32 guest at EL2,
writes to DACR32_EL2 may not be correctly synchronised by Cortex-A57,
which can lead to the guest effectively running with junk in the DACR
and running into unexpected domain faults.

This patch works around the issue by re-ordering our restoration of the
AArch32 register aliases so that they happen before the AArch64 system
registers. Ensuring that the registers are restored in this order
guarantees that they will be correctly synchronised by the core.
