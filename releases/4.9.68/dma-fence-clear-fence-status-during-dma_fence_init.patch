Subject: dma-fence: Clear fence->status during dma_fence_init()

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

commit 83dd1376fd92f33bdeca9e83d479534a4e7f870b upstream.

As the fence->status is an optional field that may be set before
dma_fence_signal() is called to convey that the fence completed with an
error, we have to ensure that it is always set to zero on initialisation
so that the typical use (i.e. unset) always flags a successful completion.
