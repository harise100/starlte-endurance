Subject: bpf: fix references to free_bpf_prog_info() in comments

From: Jakub Kicinski <jakub.kicinski@netronome.com>

[ Upstream commit ab7f5bf0928be2f148d000a6eaa6c0a36e74750e ]

Comments in the verifier refer to free_bpf_prog_info() which
seems to have never existed in tree.  Replace it with
free_used_maps().
