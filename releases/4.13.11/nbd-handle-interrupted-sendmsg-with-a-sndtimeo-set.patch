Subject: nbd: handle interrupted sendmsg with a sndtimeo set

From: Josef Bacik <jbacik@fb.com>

commit 32e67a3a06b88904155170560b7a63d372b320bd upstream.

If you do not set sk_sndtimeo you will get -ERESTARTSYS if there is a
pending signal when you enter sendmsg, which we handle properly.
However if you set a timeout for your commands we'll set sk_sndtimeo to
that timeout, which means that sendmsg will start returning -EINTR
instead of -ERESTARTSYS.  Fix this by checking either cases and doing
the correct thing.

Fixes: dc88e34d69d8 ("nbd: set sk->sk_sndtimeo for our sockets")
