Subject: intel_scu_ipcutil: underflow in scu_reg_access()

From: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>

commit b1d353ad3d5835b16724653b33c05124e1b5acf1 upstream.

"count" is controlled by the user and it can be negative.  Let's prevent
that by making it unsigned.  You have to have CAP_SYS_RAWIO to call this
function so the bug is not as serious as it could be.

Fixes: 5369c02d951a ('intel_scu_ipc: Utility driver for intel scu ipc')
