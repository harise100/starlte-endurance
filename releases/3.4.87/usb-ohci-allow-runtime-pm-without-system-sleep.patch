Subject: USB: OHCI: Allow runtime PM without system sleep

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

commit 69820e01aa756b8d228143d997f71523c1e97984 upstream.

Since ohci-hcd supports runtime PM, the .pm field in its pci_driver
structure should be protected by CONFIG_PM rather than
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP.

Without this change, OHCI controllers won't do runtime suspend if
system suspend or hibernation isn't enabled.
