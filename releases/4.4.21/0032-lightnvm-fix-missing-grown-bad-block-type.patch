Subject: [PATCH 032/135] lightnvm: fix missing grown bad block type
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

[ Upstream commit b5d4acd4cbf5029a2616084d9e9f392046d53a37 ]

The get/set bad block interface defines good block, factory bad block,
grown bad block, device reserved block, and host reserved block.
Unfortunately the grown bad block was missing, leaving the offsets wrong
for device and host side reserved blocks.

This patch adds the missing type and corrects the offsets.
