Subject: [PATCH 039/135] Drivers: hv: vss: run only on supported host versions

[ Upstream commit ed9ba608e4851144af8c7061cbb19f751c73e998 ]

The Backup integration service on WS2012 has appearently trouble to
negotiate with a guest which does not support the provided util version.
Currently the VSS driver supports only version 5/0. A WS2012 offers only
version 1/x and 3/x, and vmbus_prep_negotiate_resp correctly returns an
empty icframe_vercnt/icmsg_vercnt. But the host ignores that and
continues to send ICMSGTYPE_NEGOTIATE messages. The result are weird
errors during boot and general misbehaviour.

Check the Windows version to work around the host bug, skip hv_vss_init
on WS2012 and older.
