Subject: xhci: report U3 when link is in resume state

From: Zhuang Jin Can <jin.can.zhuang@intel.com>

commit 243292a2ad3dc365849b820a64868927168894ac upstream.

xhci_hub_report_usb3_link_state() returns pls as U0 when the link
is in resume state, and this causes usb core to think the link is in
U0 while actually it's in resume state. When usb core transfers
control request on the link, it fails with TRB error as the link
is not ready for transfer.

To fix the issue, report U3 when the link is in resume state, thus
usb core knows the link it's not ready for transfer.
