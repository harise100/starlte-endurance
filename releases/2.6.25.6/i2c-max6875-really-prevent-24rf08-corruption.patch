Subject: i2c/max6875: Really prevent 24RF08 corruption

commit 70455e790391dac85d9b483a9e286a40df1ecc7f in upstream

i2c-core takes care of the possible corruption of 24RF08 chips for
quite some times, so device drivers no longer need to do it. And they
really should not, as applying the prevention twice voids it.

I thought that I had fixed all drivers long ago but apparently I had
missed that one.
