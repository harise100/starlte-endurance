Subject: ARM: dts: OMAP5: Fix broken pbias device creation

From: Kishon Vijay Abraham I <kishon@ti.com>

commit 70caac3f25291cf715cf8f2d8c7db46f6cbefe7c upstream.

commit <ed8509edddeb> ("ARM: dts: omap5: add minimal l4 bus
layout with control module support") moved pbias_regulator dt node
from being a child node of ocp to be the child node of
omap5_padconf_global. After this device for pbias_regulator is
not created.

Fix it by adding "simple-bus" compatible property to
omap5_padconf_global dt node.

Fixes: ed8509edddeb ("ARM: dts: omap5: add minimal l4 bus
layout with control module support")
