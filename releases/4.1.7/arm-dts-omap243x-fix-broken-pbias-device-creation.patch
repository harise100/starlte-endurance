Subject: ARM: dts: omap243x: Fix broken pbias device creation

From: Kishon Vijay Abraham I <kishon@ti.com>

commit 4317c8c9121e4685561422ac267b292df8e80806 upstream.

commit <72b10ac00eb1> ("ARM: dts: omap24xx: add minimal l4 bus
layout with control module support") moved pbias_regulator dt node
from being a child node of ocp to be the child node of
scm_conf. After this device for pbias_regulator is
not created.

Fix it by adding "simple-bus" compatible property to
scm_conf dt node.

Fixes: 72b10ac00eb1 ("ARM: dts: omap24xx: add minimal l4 bus
layout with control module support")
