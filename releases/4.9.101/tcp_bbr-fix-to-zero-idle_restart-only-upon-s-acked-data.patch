Subject: tcp_bbr: fix to zero idle_restart only upon S/ACKed data

From: Neal Cardwell <ncardwell@google.com>

[ Upstream commit e6e6a278b1eaffa19d42186bfacd1ffc15a50b3f ]

Previously the bbr->idle_restart tracking was zeroing out the
bbr->idle_restart bit upon ACKs that did not SACK or ACK anything,
e.g. receiving incoming data or receiver window updates. In such
situations BBR would forget that this was a restart-from-idle
situation, and if the min_rtt had expired it would unnecessarily enter
PROBE_RTT (even though we were actually restarting from idle but had
merely forgotten that fact).

The fix is simple: we need to remember we are restarting from idle
until we receive a S/ACK for some data (a S/ACK for the first flight
of data we send as we are restarting).

This commit is a stable candidate for kernels back as far as 4.9.
