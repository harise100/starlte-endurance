Subject: LSM: add missing hook to do_compat_readv_writev()

From: James Morris <jmorris@namei.org>

This patch addresses a flaw in LSM, where there is no mediation of readv()
and writev() in for 32-bit compatible apps using a 64-bit kernel.

This bug was discovered and fixed initially in the native readv/writev
code [1], but was not fixed in the compat code.  Thanks to Al for spotting
this one.
