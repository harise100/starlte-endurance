commit 9e60290dbafdf577766e5fc5f2fdb3be450cf9a6 upstream.

After unplugging a DP MST display from the system, we have to go through
and destroy all of the DRM connectors associated with it since none of
them are valid anymore. Unfortunately, intel_dp_destroy_mst_connector()
doesn't do a good enough job of ensuring that throughout the destruction
process that no modesettings can be done with the connectors. As it is
right now, intel_dp_destroy_mst_connector() works like this:

* Take all modeset locks
* Clear the configuration of the crtc on the connector, if there is one
* Drop all modeset locks, this is required because of circular
  dependency issues that arise with trying to remove the connector from
  sysfs with modeset locks held
* Unregister the connector
* Take all modeset locks, again
* Do the rest of the required cleaning for destroying the connector
* Finally drop all modeset locks for good

This only works sometimes. During the destruction process, it's very
possible that a userspace application will attempt to do a modesetting
using the connector. When we drop the modeset locks, an ioctl handler
such as drm_mode_setcrtc has the oppurtunity to take all of the modeset
locks from us. When this happens, one thing leads to another and
eventually we end up committing a mode with the non-existent connector:

	[drm:intel_dp_link_training_clock_recovery [i915]] *ERROR* failed to enable link training
	[drm:intel_dp_aux_ch] dp_aux_ch timeout status 0x7cf0001f
	[drm:intel_dp_start_link_train [i915]] *ERROR* failed to start channel equalization
	[drm:intel_dp_aux_ch] dp_aux_ch timeout status 0x7cf0001f
	[drm:intel_mst_pre_enable_dp [i915]] *ERROR* failed to allocate vcpi

And in some cases, such as with the T460s using an MST dock, this
results in breaking modesetting and/or panicking the system.

To work around this, we now unregister the connector at the very
beginning of intel_dp_destroy_mst_connector(), grab all the modesetting
locks, and then hold them until we finish the rest of the function.
