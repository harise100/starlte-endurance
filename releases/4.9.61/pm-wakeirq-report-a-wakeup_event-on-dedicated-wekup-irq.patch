Subject: PM / wakeirq: report a wakeup_event on dedicated wekup irq

From: Grygorii Strashko <grygorii.strashko@ti.com>


[ Upstream commit 09bb6e93956ae5175b96905b723ec879c3ca0765 ]

There are two reasons for reporting wakeup event when dedicated wakeup
IRQ is triggered:

- wakeup events accounting, so proper statistical data will be
  displayed in sysfs and debugfs;

- there are small window when System is entering suspend during which
  dedicated wakeup IRQ can be lost:

dpm_suspend_noirq()
  |- device_wakeup_arm_wake_irqs()
      |- dev_pm_arm_wake_irq(X)
         |- IRQ is enabled and marked as wakeup source
[1]...
  |- suspend_device_irqs()
     |- suspend_device_irq(X)
	|- irqd_set(X, IRQD_WAKEUP_ARMED);
	   |- wakup IRQ armed

The wakeup IRQ can be lost if it's triggered at point [1]
and not armed yet.

Hence, fix above cases by adding simple pm_wakeup_event() call in
handle_threaded_wake_irq().
