Subject: arm64: armv8_deprecated: ensure extension of addr

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

commit 55de49f9aa17b0b2b144dd2af587177b9aadf429 upstream.

Our compat swp emulation holds the compat user address in an unsigned
int, which it passes to __user_swpX_asm(). When a 32-bit value is passed
in a register, the upper 32 bits of the register are unknown, and we
must extend the value to 64 bits before we can use it as a base address.

This patch casts the address to unsigned long to ensure it has been
suitably extended, avoiding the potential issue, and silencing a related
warning from clang.
