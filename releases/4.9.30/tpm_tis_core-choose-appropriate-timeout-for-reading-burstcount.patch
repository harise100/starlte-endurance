Subject: tpm_tis_core: Choose appropriate timeout for reading burstcount

From: Alexander Steffen <Alexander.Steffen@infineon.com>

commit 302a6ad7fc77146191126a1f3e2c5d724fd72416 upstream.

TIS v1.3 for TPM 1.2 and PTP for TPM 2.0 disagree about which timeout
value applies to reading a valid burstcount. It is TIMEOUT_D according to
TIS, but TIMEOUT_A according to PTP, so choose the appropriate value
depending on whether we deal with a TPM 1.2 or a TPM 2.0.

This is important since according to the PTP TIMEOUT_D is much smaller
than TIMEOUT_A. So the previous implementation could run into timeouts
with a TPM 2.0, even though the TPM was behaving perfectly fine.

During tpm2_probe TIMEOUT_D will be used even with a TPM 2.0, because
TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2 is not yet set. This is fine, since the timeout values
will only be changed afterwards by tpm_get_timeouts. Until then
TIS_TIMEOUT_D_MAX applies, which is large enough.
