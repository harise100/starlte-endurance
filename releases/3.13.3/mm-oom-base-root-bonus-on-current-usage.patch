Subject: mm, oom: base root bonus on current usage

From: David Rientjes <rientjes@google.com>

commit 778c14affaf94a9e4953179d3e13a544ccce7707 upstream.

A 3% of system memory bonus is sometimes too excessive in comparison to
other processes.

With commit a63d83f427fb ("oom: badness heuristic rewrite"), the OOM
killer tries to avoid killing privileged tasks by subtracting 3% of
overall memory (system or cgroup) from their per-task consumption.  But
as a result, all root tasks that consume less than 3% of overall memory
are considered equal, and so it only takes 33+ privileged tasks pushing
the system out of memory for the OOM killer to do something stupid and
kill dhclient or other root-owned processes.  For example, on a 32G
machine it can't tell the difference between the 1M agetty and the 10G
fork bomb member.

The changelog describes this 3% boost as the equivalent to the global
overcommit limit being 3% higher for privileged tasks, but this is not
the same as discounting 3% of overall memory from _every privileged task
individually_ during OOM selection.

Replace the 3% of system memory bonus with a 3% of current memory usage
bonus.

By giving root tasks a bonus that is proportional to their actual size,
they remain comparable even when relatively small.  In the example
above, the OOM killer will discount the 1M agetty's 256 badness points
down to 179, and the 10G fork bomb's 262144 points down to 183500 points
and make the right choice, instead of discounting both to 0 and killing
agetty because it's first in the task list.
