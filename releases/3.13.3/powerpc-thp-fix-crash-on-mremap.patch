Subject: powerpc/thp: Fix crash on mremap

From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit b3084f4db3aeb991c507ca774337c7e7893ed04f upstream.

This patch fix the below crash

NIP [c00000000004cee4] .__hash_page_thp+0x2a4/0x440
LR [c0000000000439ac] .hash_page+0x18c/0x5e0

On ppc64 we use the pgtable for storing the hpte slot information and
store address to the pgtable at a constant offset (PTRS_PER_PMD) from
pmd. On mremap, when we switch the pmd, we need to withdraw and deposit
the pgtable again, so that we find the pgtable at PTRS_PER_PMD offset
from new pmd.

We also want to move the withdraw and deposit before the set_pmd so
that, when page fault find the pmd as trans huge we can be sure that
pgtable can be located at the offset.
