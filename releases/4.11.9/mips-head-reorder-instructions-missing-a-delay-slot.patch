Subject: MIPS: head: Reorder instructions missing a delay slot

From: Karl Beldan <karl.beldan@gmail.com>

commit 25d8b92e0af75d72ce8b99e63e5a449cc0888efa upstream.

In this sequence the 'move' is assumed in the delay slot of the 'beq',
but head.S is in reorder mode and the former gets pushed one 'nop'
farther by the assembler.

The corrected behavior made booting with an UHI supplied dtb erratic.

Fixes: 15f37e158892 ("MIPS: store the appended dtb address in a variable")
