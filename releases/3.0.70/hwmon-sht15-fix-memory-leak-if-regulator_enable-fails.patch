Subject: hwmon: (sht15) Fix memory leak if regulator_enable() fails

Commit 3e78080f8148 ('hwmon: (sht15) Check return value of
regulator_enable()') depends on the use of devm_kmalloc() for automatic
resource cleanup in the failure cases, which was introduced in 3.7.  In
older stable branches, explicit cleanup is needed.
