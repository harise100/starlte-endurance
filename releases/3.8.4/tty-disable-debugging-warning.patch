Subject: TTY: disable debugging warning

From: Jiri Slaby <jslaby@suse.cz>

commit 34dcfb8479ab3c3669561eb9279284cb0eda2572 upstream.

We added a warning to flush_to_ldisc to report cases when it is called
with a NULL tty. It was for debugging purposes and it lead to a
patchset from Peter Hurley. The patchset however did not make it to
3.9, so disable the warning now to not disturb people.

We can re-add it when the series is in and we are hunting for another
bugs.
