Subject: ipv6/exthdrs: accept tlv which includes only padding

From: Jiri Pirko <jiri@resnulli.us>

[ Upstream commit 8112b1fe071be01a28a774ed55909e6f4b29712d ]

In rfc4942 and rfc2460 I cannot find anything which would implicate to
drop packets which have only padding in tlv.

Current behaviour breaks TAHI Test v6LC.1.2.6.

Problem was intruduced in:
9b905fe6843 "ipv6/exthdrs: strict Pad1 and PadN check"
