Subject: ubi: Reject MLC NAND

From: Richard Weinberger <richard@nod.at>

commit b5094b7f135be34630e3ea8a98fa215715d0f29d upstream.

While UBI and UBIFS seem to work at first sight with MLC NAND, you will
most likely lose all your data upon a power-cut or due to read/write
disturb.
In order to protect users from bad surprises, refuse to attach to MLC
NAND.
