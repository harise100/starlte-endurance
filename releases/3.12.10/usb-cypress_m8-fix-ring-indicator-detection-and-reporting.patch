Subject: USB: cypress_m8: fix ring-indicator detection and reporting

From: Johan Hovold <jhovold@gmail.com>

commit 440ebadeae9298d7de3d4d105342691841ec88d0 upstream.

Fix ring-indicator (RI) status-bit definition, which was defined as CTS,
effectively preventing RI-changes from being detected while reporting
false RI status.

This bug predates git.
