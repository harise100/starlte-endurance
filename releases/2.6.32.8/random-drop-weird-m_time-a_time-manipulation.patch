Subject: random: drop weird m_time/a_time manipulation

From: Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com>

commit a996996dd75a9086b12d1cb4010f26e1748993f0 upstream.

No other driver does anything remotely like this that I know of except
for the tty drivers, and I can't see any reason for random/urandom to do
it. In fact, it's a (trivial, harmless) timing information leak. And
obviously, it generates power- and flash-cycle wasting I/O, especially
if combined with something like hwrngd. Also, it breaks ubifs's
expectations.
