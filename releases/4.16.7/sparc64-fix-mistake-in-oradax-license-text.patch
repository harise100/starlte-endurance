Subject: sparc64: Fix mistake in oradax license text

From: Rob Gardner <rob.gardner@oracle.com>

commit d3c68d0b4183ddfa05577348a231dd117e6563df upstream.

The license text in both oradax files mistakenly specifies "version 3" of
the GNU General Public License.  This is corrected to specify "version 2".
