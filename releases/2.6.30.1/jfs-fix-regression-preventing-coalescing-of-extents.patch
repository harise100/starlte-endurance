Subject: jfs: fix regression preventing coalescing of extents

From: Dave Kleikamp <shaggy@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit f7c52fd17a7dda42fc9e88c2b2678403419bfe63 upstream.

Commit fec1878fe952b994125a3be7c94b1322db586f3b caused a regression in
which contiguous blocks being allocated to the end of an extent were
getting a new extent created.  This typically results in files entirely
made up of 1-block extents even though the blocks are contiguous on
disk.

Apparently grub doesn't handle a jfs file being fragmented into too many
extents, since it refuses to boot a kernel from jfs that was created by
the 2.6.30 kernel.
