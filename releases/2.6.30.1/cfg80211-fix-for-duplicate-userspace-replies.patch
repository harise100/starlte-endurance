Subject: cfg80211: fix for duplicate userspace replies

From: Luis R. Rodriguez <lrodriguez@atheros.com>

commit 729e9c7663190d71fe5e29831634df80f38199c1 upstream.

This fixes an incorrect assumption (BUG_ON) made in
cfg80211 when handling country IE regulatory requests.
The assumption was that we won't try to call_crda()
twice for the same event and therefore we will not
recieve two replies through nl80211 for the regulatory
request. As it turns out it is true we don't call_crda()
twice for the same event, however, kobject_uevent_env()
*might* send the udev event twice and/or userspace can
simply process the udev event twice. We remove the BUG_ON()
and simply ignore the duplicate request.

For details refer to this thread:
