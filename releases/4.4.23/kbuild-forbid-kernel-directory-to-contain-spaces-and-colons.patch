Subject: kbuild: forbid kernel directory to contain spaces and colons

From: Robert Jarzmik <robert.jarzmik@free.fr>

commit 51193b76bfff5027cf96ba63effae808ad67cca7 upstream.

When the kernel path contains a space or a colon somewhere in the path
name, the modules_install target doesn't work anymore, as the path names
are not enclosed in double quotes. It is also supposed that and O= build
will suffer from the same weakness as modules_install.

Instead of checking and improving kbuild to resist to directories
including these characters, error out early to prevent any build if the
kernel's main directory contains a space.
