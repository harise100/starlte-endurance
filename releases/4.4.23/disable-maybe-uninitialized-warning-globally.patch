Subject: Disable "maybe-uninitialized" warning globally

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

commit 6e8d666e925333c55378e8d5540a8a9ee0eea9c5 upstream.

Several build configurations had already disabled this warning because
it generates a lot of false positives.  But some had not, and it was
still enabled for "allmodconfig" builds, for example.

Looking at the warnings produced, every single one I looked at was a
false positive, and the warnings are frequent enough (and big enough)
that they can easily hide real problems that you don't notice in the
noise generated by -Wmaybe-uninitialized.

The warning is good in theory, but this is a classic case of a warning
that causes more problems than the warning can solve.

If gcc gets better at avoiding false positives, we may be able to
re-enable this warning.  But as is, we're better off without it, and I
want to be able to see the *real* warnings.
