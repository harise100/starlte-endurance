Subject: x86: kprobes: fix swapped segment registers in kretprobe

From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>

commit a197479848a2f1a2a5c07cffa6c31ab5e8c82797 upstream.

In commit f007ea26, the order of the %es and %ds segment registers
got accidentally swapped, so synthesized 'struct pt_regs' frames
have the two values inverted.  It's almost sure that these values
never matter, and that they also never differ.  But wrong is wrong.
