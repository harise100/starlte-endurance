Subject: Revert "ARM: at91/dt: sama5d2: Use new compatible for ohci node"

From: Romain Izard <romain.izard.pro@gmail.com>

commit 9e10889a3177340dcda7d29c6d8fbd97247b007b upstream.

This reverts commit cab43282682e ("ARM: at91/dt: sama5d2: Use new
compatible for ohci node")

It depends from commit 7150bc9b4d43 ("usb: ohci-at91: Forcibly suspend
ports while USB suspend") which was reverted and implemented
differently. With the new implementation, the compatible string must
remain the same.

The compatible string introduced by this commit has been used in the
default SAMA5D2 dtsi starting from Linux 4.8. As it has never been
working correctly in an official release, removing it should not be
breaking the stability rules.
