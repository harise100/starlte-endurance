Subject: net: vrf: Reset rt6i_idev in local dst after put

From: David Ahern <dsa@cumulusnetworks.com>


[ Upstream commit 3dc857f0e8fc22610a59cbb346ba62c6e921863f ]

The VRF driver takes a reference to the inet6_dev on the VRF device for
its rt6_local dst when handling local traffic through the VRF device as
a loopback. When the device is deleted the driver does a put on the idev
but does not reset rt6i_idev in the rt6_info struct. When the dst is
destroyed, dst_destroy calls ip6_dst_destroy which does a second put for
what is essentially the same reference causing it to be prematurely freed.
Reset rt6i_idev after the put in the vrf driver.

Fixes: b4869aa2f881e ("net: vrf: ipv6 support for local traffic to
                       local addresses")
