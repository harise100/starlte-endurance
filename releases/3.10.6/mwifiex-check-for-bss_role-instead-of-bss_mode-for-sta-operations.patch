Subject: mwifiex: check for bss_role instead of bss_mode for STA operations

From: Avinash Patil <patila@marvell.com>

commit 953b3539ef9301b8ef73f4b6e2fd824b86aae65a upstream.

This patch fixes an issue wherein association would fail on P2P
interfaces. This happened because we are checking priv->mode
against NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION. While this check is correct for
infrastructure stations, it would fail P2P clients for which mode
is NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_CLIENT.

Better check would be bss_role which has only 2 values: STA/AP.
