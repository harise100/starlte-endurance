Subject: nfsd4: don't close read-write opens too soon

From: "J. Bruce Fields" <bfields@redhat.com>

commit 0c7c3e67ab91ec6caa44bdf1fc89a48012ceb0c5 upstream.

Don't actually close any opens until we don't need them at all.

This means being left with write access when it's not really necessary,
but that's better than putting a file that might still have posix locks
held on it, as we have been.
