Subject: ACPI / drivers: fix typo in ACPI_DECLARE_PROBE_ENTRY macro

From: Lorenzo Pieralisi <lorenzo.pieralisi@arm.com>

commit 3feab13c919f99b0a17d0ca22ae00cf90f5d3fd1 upstream.

When the ACPI_DECLARE_PROBE_ENTRY macro was added in
commit e647b532275b ("ACPI: Add early device probing infrastructure"),
a stub macro adding an unused entry was added for the !CONFIG_ACPI
Kconfig option case to make sure kernel code making use of the
macro did not require to be guarded within CONFIG_ACPI in order to
be compiled.

The stub macro was never used since all kernel code that defines
ACPI_DECLARE_PROBE_ENTRY entries is currently guarded within
CONFIG_ACPI; it contains a typo that should be nonetheless fixed.

Fix the typo in the stub (ie !CONFIG_ACPI) ACPI_DECLARE_PROBE_ENTRY()
macro so that it can actually be used if needed.
