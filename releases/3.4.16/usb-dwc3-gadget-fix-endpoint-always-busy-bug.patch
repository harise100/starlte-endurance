Subject: usb: dwc3: gadget: fix 'endpoint always busy' bug

From: Felipe Balbi <balbi@ti.com>

commit 041d81f493d90c940ec41f0ec98bc7c4f2fba431 upstream.

If a USB transfer has already been started, meaning
we have already issued StartTransfer command to that
particular endpoint, DWC3_EP_BUSY flag has also
already been set.

When we try to cancel this transfer which is already
in controller's cache, we will not receive XferComplete
event and we must clear DWC3_EP_BUSY in order to allow
subsequent requests to be properly started.

The best place to clear that flag is right after issuing
DWC3_DEPCMD_ENDTRANSFER.
