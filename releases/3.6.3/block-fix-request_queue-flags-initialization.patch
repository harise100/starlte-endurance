Subject: block: fix request_queue->flags initialization

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit 60ea8226cbd5c8301f9a39edc574ddabcb8150e0 upstream.

A queue newly allocated with blk_alloc_queue_node() has only
QUEUE_FLAG_BYPASS set.  For request-based drivers,
blk_init_allocated_queue() is called and q->queue_flags is overwritten
with QUEUE_FLAG_DEFAULT which doesn't include BYPASS even though the
initial bypass is still in effect.

In blk_init_allocated_queue(), or QUEUE_FLAG_DEFAULT to q->queue_flags
instead of overwriting.
