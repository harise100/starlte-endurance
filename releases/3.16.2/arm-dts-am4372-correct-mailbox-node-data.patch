Subject: ARM: dts: AM4372: Correct mailbox node data

From: Suman Anna <s-anna@ti.com>

commit 44e6ab1b619853f05bf7250e55a6d82864e340d7 upstream.

The mailbox DT node for AM4372 is enabled and is corrected to
remove some properties that have crept in by mistake.

Fixes: 9e3269b (ARM: dts: AM4372: Add L2, EDMA, mailbox, MMC and SHAM nodes)
