Subject: ARM: 8097/1: unistd.h: relocate comments back to place

From: Baruch Siach <baruch@tkos.co.il>

commit bc994c77ce82576209dcf08f71de9ae51b0b100f upstream.

Commit cb8db5d45 (UAPI: (Scripted) Disintegrate arch/arm/include/asm) moved
these syscall comments out of their context into the UAPI headers. Fix this.

Fixes: cb8db5d4578a ("UAPI: (Scripted) Disintegrate arch/arm/include/asm")
