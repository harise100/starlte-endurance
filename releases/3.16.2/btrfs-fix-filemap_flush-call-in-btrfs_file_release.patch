Subject: Btrfs: fix filemap_flush call in btrfs_file_release

From: Chris Mason <clm@fb.com>

commit f6dc45c7a93a011dff6eb9b2ffda59c390c7705a upstream.

We should only be flushing on close if the file was flagged as needing
it during truncate.  I broke this with my ordered data vs transaction
commit deadlock fix.

Thanks to Miao Xie for catching this.
