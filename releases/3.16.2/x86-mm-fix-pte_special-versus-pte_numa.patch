Subject: x86,mm: fix pte_special versus pte_numa

From: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

commit b38af4721f59d0b564468f623b3e52a638195015 upstream.

Sasha Levin has shown oopses on ffffea0003480048 and ffffea0003480008 at
mm/memory.c:1132, running Trinity on different 3.16-rc-next kernels:
where zap_pte_range() checks page->mapping to see if PageAnon(page).

Those addresses fit struct pages for pfns d2001 and d2000, and in each
dump a register or a stack slot showed d2001730 or d2000730: pte flags
0x730 are PCD ACCESSED PROTNONE SPECIAL IOMAP; and Sasha's e820 map has
a hole between cfffffff and 100000000, which would need special access.

Commit c46a7c817e66 ("x86: define _PAGE_NUMA by reusing software bits on
the PMD and PTE levels") has broken vm_normal_page(): a PROTNONE SPECIAL
pte no longer passes the pte_special() test, so zap_pte_range() goes on
to try to access a non-existent struct page.

Fix this by refining pte_special() (SPECIAL with PRESENT or PROTNONE) to
complement pte_numa() (SPECIAL with neither PRESENT nor PROTNONE).  A
hint that this was a problem was that c46a7c817e66 added pte_numa() test
to vm_normal_page(), and moved its is_zero_pfn() test from slow to fast
path: This was papering over a pte_special() snag when the zero page was
encountered during zap.  This patch reverts vm_normal_page() to how it
was before, relying on pte_special().

It still appears that this patch may be incomplete: aren't there other
places which need to be handling PROTNONE along with PRESENT?  For
example, pte_mknuma() clears _PAGE_PRESENT and sets _PAGE_NUMA, but on a
PROT_NONE area, that would make it pte_special().  This is side-stepped
by the fact that NUMA hinting faults skipped PROT_NONE VMAs and there
are no grounds where a NUMA hinting fault on a PROT_NONE VMA would be
interesting.

Fixes: c46a7c817e66 ("x86: define _PAGE_NUMA by reusing software bits on the PMD and PTE levels")
