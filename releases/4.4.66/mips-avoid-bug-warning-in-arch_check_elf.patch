Subject: MIPS: Avoid BUG warning in arch_check_elf

From: James Cowgill <James.Cowgill@imgtec.com>

commit c46f59e90226fa5bfcc83650edebe84ae47d454b upstream.

arch_check_elf contains a usage of current_cpu_data that will call
smp_processor_id() with preemption enabled and therefore triggers a
"BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible" warning when an fpxx
executable is loaded.

As a follow-up to commit b244614a60ab ("MIPS: Avoid a BUG warning during
prctl(PR_SET_FP_MODE, ...)"), apply the same fix to arch_check_elf by
using raw_current_cpu_data instead. The rationale quoted from the previous
commit:

"It is assumed throughout the kernel that if any CPU has an FPU, then
all CPUs would have an FPU as well, so it is safe to perform the check
with preemption enabled - change the code to use raw_ variant of the
check to avoid the warning."
