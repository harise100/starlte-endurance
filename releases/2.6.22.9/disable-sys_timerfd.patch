Subject: disable sys_timerfd()

From: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>

commit e42601973b1bce1d2987f82159c1ebeaccc6b310 in mainline.

There is still some confusion and disagreement over what this interface should
actually do.  So it is best that we disable it in 2.6.23 until we get that
fully sorted out.

(sys_timerfd() was present in 2.6.22 but it was apparently broken, so here we
assume that nobody is using it yet).
