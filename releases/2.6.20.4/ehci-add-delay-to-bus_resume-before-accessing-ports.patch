Subject: EHCI: add delay to bus_resume before accessing ports
To: stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44L0.0703160928380.3039-100000@iolanthe.rowland.org>

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>

This patch (as870) adds a delay to ehci-hcd's bus_resume routine.
Apparently there are controllers and/or BIOSes out there which need
such a delay to get the ports back into their correct state.  This
fixes Bugzilla #8190.
