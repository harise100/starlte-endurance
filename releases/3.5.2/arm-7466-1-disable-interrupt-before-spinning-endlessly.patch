Subject: ARM: 7466/1: disable interrupt before spinning endlessly

From: Shawn Guo <shawn.guo@linaro.org>

commit 98bd8b96b26db3399a48202318dca4aaa2515355 upstream.

The CPU will endlessly spin at the end of machine_halt and
machine_restart calls.  However, this will lead to a soft lockup
warning after about 20 seconds, if CONFIG_LOCKUP_DETECTOR is enabled,
as system timer is still alive.

Disable interrupt before going to spin endlessly, so that the lockup
warning will never be seen.
