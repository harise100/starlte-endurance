Subject: drm/vmwgfx: Free hash table allocated by cmdbuf managed res mgr

From: Deepak Rawat <drawat@vmware.com>

commit 82fcee526ba8ca2c5d378bdf51b21b7eb058fe3a upstream.

The hash table created during vmw_cmdbuf_res_man_create was
never freed. This causes memory leak in context creation.
Added the corresponding drm_ht_remove in vmw_cmdbuf_res_man_destroy.

Tested for memory leak by running piglit overnight and kernel
memory is not inflated which earlier was.
