Subject: staging: ashmem: Fix ASHMEM_PURGE_ALL_CACHES return value

From: John Stultz <john.stultz@linaro.org>

commit 5957324045ba2c127c9401fa3ac61ac52e043ca8 upstream.

Hopefully this isn't too late for 3.12.

In commit 7dc19d5aff (convert shrinkers to new count/scan API)
the return value to PURGE_ALL_CACHES was dropped, causing -EPERM
to always be returned.

This patch re-adds the ret assignment, setting it to the the
ashmem_shrink_count(), which is the lru_count.

(Sorry this was missed in the review!)
