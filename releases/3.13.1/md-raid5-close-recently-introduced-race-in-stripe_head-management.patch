Subject: md/raid5: close recently introduced race in stripe_head management.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 7da9d450ab2843bf1db378c156acc6304dbc1c2b upstream.

As release_stripe and __release_stripe decrement ->count and then
manipulate ->lru both under ->device_lock, it is important that
get_active_stripe() increments ->count and clears ->lru also under
->device_lock.

However we currently list_del_init ->lru under the lock, but increment
the ->count outside the lock.  This can lead to races and list
corruption.

So move the atomic_inc(&sh->count) up inside the ->device_lock
protected region.

Note that we still increment ->count without device lock in the case
where get_free_stripe() was called, and in fact don't take
->device_lock at all in that path.
This is safe because if the stripe_head can be found by
get_free_stripe, then the hash lock assures us the no-one else could
possibly be calling release_stripe() at the same time.
