Subject: mac80211: drop spoofed packets in ad-hoc mode

From: Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org>

commit 6329b8d917adc077caa60c2447385554130853a3 upstream.

If an Ad-Hoc node receives packets with the Cell ID or its own MAC
address as source address, it hits a WARN_ON in sta_info_insert_check()
With many packets, this can massively spam the logs. One way that this
can easily happen is through having Cisco APs in the area with rouge AP
detection and countermeasures enabled.
Such Cisco APs will regularly send fake beacons, disassoc and deauth
packets that trigger these warnings.

To fix this issue, drop such spoofed packets early in the rx path.
