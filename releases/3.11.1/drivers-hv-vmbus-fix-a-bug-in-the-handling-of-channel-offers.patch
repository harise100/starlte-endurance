Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix a bug in the handling of channel offers

From: "K. Y. Srinivasan" <kys@microsoft.com>

commit 42dceebe34600b2d02a38baa3e869009ba3d14c7 upstream.

The channel state should be correctly set before registering the device. In the current
code the driver probe would fail for channels that have been rescinded and subsequently
re-offered. Fix the bug.
