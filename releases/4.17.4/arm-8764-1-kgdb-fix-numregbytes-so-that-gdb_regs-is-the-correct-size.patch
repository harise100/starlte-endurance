Subject: ARM: 8764/1: kgdb: fix NUMREGBYTES so that gdb_regs[] is the correct size

From: David Rivshin <DRivshin@allworx.com>

commit 76ed0b803a2ab793a1b27d1dfe0de7955282cd34 upstream.

NUMREGBYTES (which is used as the size for gdb_regs[]) is incorrectly
based on DBG_MAX_REG_NUM instead of GDB_MAX_REGS. DBG_MAX_REG_NUM
is the number of total registers, while GDB_MAX_REGS is the number
of 'unsigned longs' it takes to serialize those registers. Since
FP registers require 3 'unsigned longs' each, DBG_MAX_REG_NUM is
smaller than GDB_MAX_REGS.

This causes GDB 8.0 give the following error on connect:
"Truncated register 19 in remote 'g' packet"

This also causes the register serialization/deserialization logic
to overflow gdb_regs[], overwriting whatever follows.
