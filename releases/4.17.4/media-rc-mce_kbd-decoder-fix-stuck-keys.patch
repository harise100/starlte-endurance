Subject: media: rc: mce_kbd decoder: fix stuck keys

From: Sean Young <sean@mess.org>

commit 63039c29f7a4ce8a8bd165173840543c0098d7b0 upstream.

The MCE Remote sends a 0 scancode when keys are released. If this is not
received or decoded, then keys can get "stuck"; the keyup event is not
sent since the input_sync() is missing from the timeout handler.
