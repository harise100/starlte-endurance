Subject: Revert "i2c: algo-bit: init the bus to a known state"

From: Wolfram Sang <wsa+renesas@sang-engineering.com>

commit 2a2c8ee2d72c4f1ba0f7fbb02dc74f971df0f934 upstream.

This reverts commit 3e5f06bed72fe72166a6778f630241a893f67799. As per
bugzilla #200045, this caused a regression. I don't really see a way to
fix it without having the hardware. So, revert the patch and I will fix
the issue I was seeing originally in the i2c-gpio driver itself. I
couldn't find new users of this algorithm since, so there should be no
one depending on the new behaviour.
