Subject: MCE: Fix vm86 handling for 32bit mce handler

From: Andi Kleen <andi@firstfloor.org>

commit a129a7c84582629741e5fa6f40026efcd7a65bd4 upstream.

When running on 32bit the mce handler could misinterpret
vm86 mode as ring 0. This can affect whether it does recovery
or not; it was possible to panic when recovery was actually
possible.

Fix this by always forcing vm86 to look like ring 3.
