Subject: KVM: x86: Increase the number of fixed MTRR regs to 10

From: Nadav Amit <namit@cs.technion.ac.il>

commit 682367c494869008eb89ef733f196e99415ae862 upstream.

Recent Intel CPUs have 10 variable range MTRRs. Since operating systems
sometime make assumptions on CPUs while they ignore capability MSRs, it is
better for KVM to be consistent with recent CPUs. Reporting more MTRRs than
actually supported has no functional implications.
