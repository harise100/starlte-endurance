Subject: bpf: change back to orig prog on too many passes

From: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>


[ Upstream commit 9d5ecb09d525469abd1a10c096cb5a17206523f2 ]

If after too many passes still no image could be emitted, then
swap back to the original program as we do in all other cases
and don't use the one with blinding.

Fixes: 959a75791603 ("bpf, x86: add support for constant blinding")
