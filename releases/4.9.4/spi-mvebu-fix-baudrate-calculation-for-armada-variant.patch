Subject: spi: mvebu: fix baudrate calculation for armada variant

From: Uwe Kleine-König <uwe@kleine-koenig.org>

commit 7243e0b20729d372e97763617a7a9c89f29b33e1 upstream.

The calculation of SPR and SPPR doesn't round correctly at several
places which might result in baud rates that are too big. For example
with tclk_hz = 250000001 and target rate 25000000 it determined a
divider of 10 which is wrong.

Instead of fixing all the corner cases replace the calculation by an
algorithm without a loop which should even be quicker to execute apart
from being correct.
