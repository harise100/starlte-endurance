Subject: netfilter: xt_limit: have r->cost != 0 case work

From: Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

commit 82e6bfe2fbc4d48852114c4f979137cd5bf1d1a8 upstream.

Commit v2.6.19-rc1~1272^2~41 tells us that r->cost != 0 can happen when
a running state is saved to userspace and then reinstated from there.

Make sure that private xt_limit area is initialized with correct values.
Otherwise, random matchings due to use of uninitialized memory.
