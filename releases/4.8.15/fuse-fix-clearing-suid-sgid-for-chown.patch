Subject: fuse: fix clearing suid, sgid for chown()

From: Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@redhat.com>

commit c01638f5d919728f565bf8b5e0a6a159642df0d9 upstream.

Basically, the pjdfstests set the ownership of a file to 06555, and then
chowns it (as root) to a new uid/gid. Prior to commit a09f99eddef4 ("fuse:
fix killing s[ug]id in setattr"), fuse would send down a setattr with both
the uid/gid change and a new mode.  Now, it just sends down the uid/gid
change.

Technically this is NOTABUG, since POSIX doesn't _require_ that we clear
these bits for a privileged process, but Linux (wisely) has done that and I
think we don't want to change that behavior here.

This is caused by the use of should_remove_suid(), which will always return
0 when the process has CAP_FSETID.

In fact we really don't need to be calling should_remove_suid() at all,
since we've already been indicated that we should remove the suid, we just
don't want to use a (very) stale mode for that.

This patch should fix the above as well as simplify the logic.
