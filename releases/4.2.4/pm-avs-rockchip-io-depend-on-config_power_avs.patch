Subject: PM / AVS: rockchip-io: depend on CONFIG_POWER_AVS

From: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de>

commit 28c1f1628ee4b163e615eefe1b6463e3d229a873 upstream.

The rockchip io-domain driver currently only depends on ARCH_ROCKCHIP
itself. This makes it possible to select the power-domain driver, but
not the POWER_AVS class and results in the iodomain-driver not getting
build in this case.

So add the additional dependency, which also results in the driver
config option now being placed nicely into the AVS submenu.
