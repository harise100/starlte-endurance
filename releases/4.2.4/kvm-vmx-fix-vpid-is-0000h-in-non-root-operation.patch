Subject: KVM: vmx: fix VPID is 0000H in non-root operation

commit 04bb92e4b4cf06a66889d37b892b78f926faa9d4 upstream.

Reference SDM 28.1:

The current VPID is 0000H in the following situations:
- Outside VMX operation. (This includes operation in system-management
  mode under the default treatment of SMIs and SMM with VMX operation;
  see Section 34.14.)
- In VMX root operation.
- In VMX non-root operation when the “enable VPID” VM-execution control
  is 0.

The VPID should never be 0000H in non-root operation when "enable VPID"
VM-execution control is 1. However, commit 34a1cd60 ("kvm: x86: vmx:
move some vmx setting from vmx_init() to hardware_setup()") remove the
codes which reserve 0000H for VMX root operation.

This patch fix it by again reserving 0000H for VMX root operation.
