Subject: dm thin: disable discard support for thin devices if pool's is disabled

From: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>

commit 216076705d6ac291d42e0f8dd85e6a0da98c0fa3 upstream.

If the pool is configured with 'ignore_discard' its discard support is
disabled.  The pool's thin devices should also have queue_limits that
reflect discards are disabled.

Fixes: 34fbcf62 ("dm thin: range discard support")
