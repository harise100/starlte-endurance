Subject: ARM: 8429/1: disable GCC SRA optimization

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

commit a077224fd35b2f7fbc93f14cf67074fc792fbac2 upstream.

While working on the 32-bit ARM port of UEFI, I noticed a strange
corruption in the kernel log. The following snprintf() statement
(in drivers/firmware/efi/efi.c:efi_md_typeattr_format())

	snprintf(pos, size, "|%3s|%2s|%2s|%2s|%3s|%2s|%2s|%2s|%2s]",

was producing the following output in the log:

	|    |   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]
	|    |   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]
	|    |   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]
	|RUN|   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]*
	|RUN|   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]*
	|    |   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]
	|RUN|   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]*
	|    |   |   |   |    |WB|WT|WC|UC]
	|RUN|   |   |   |    |   |   |   |UC]
	|RUN|   |   |   |    |   |   |   |UC]

As it turns out, this is caused by incorrect code being emitted for
the string() function in lib/vsprintf.c. The following code

	if (!(spec.flags & LEFT)) {
		while (len < spec.field_width--) {
			if (buf < end)
				*buf = ' ';
			++buf;
		}
	}
	for (i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
		if (buf < end)
			*buf = *s;
		++buf; ++s;
	}
	while (len < spec.field_width--) {
		if (buf < end)
			*buf = ' ';
		++buf;
	}

when called with len == 0, triggers an issue in the GCC SRA optimization
pass (Scalar Replacement of Aggregates), which handles promotion of signed
struct members incorrectly. This is a known but as yet unresolved issue.
(https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65932). In this particular
case, it is causing the second while loop to be executed erroneously a
single time, causing the additional space characters to be printed.

So disable the optimization by passing -fno-ipa-sra.
