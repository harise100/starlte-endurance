Subject: ARM: dts: sunxi: Raise minimum CPU voltage for sun7i-a20 to meet SoC specifications

From: Timo Sigurdsson <public_timo.s@silentcreek.de>

commit eaeef1ad9b6ea6df1d1220c254d9563da60cb9d1 upstream.

sun7i-a20.dtsi contains a cpufreq operating point at 0.9 volts. The minimum
CPU voltage for the Allwinner A20 SoC, however, is 1.0 volts. Thus, raise
the voltage for the lowest operating point to 1.0 volts in order to stay
within the SoC specifications. It is an undervolted setting that isn't
stable across all SoCs and boards out there.
