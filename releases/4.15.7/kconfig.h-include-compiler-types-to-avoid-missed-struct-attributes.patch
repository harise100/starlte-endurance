Subject: kconfig.h: Include compiler types to avoid missed struct attributes

From: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>

commit 28128c61e08eaeced9cc8ec0e6b5d677b5b94690 upstream.

The header files for some structures could get included in such a way
that struct attributes (specifically __randomize_layout from path.h) would
be parsed as variable names instead of attributes. This could lead to
some instances of a structure being unrandomized, causing nasty GPFs, etc.

This patch makes sure the compiler_types.h header is included in
kconfig.h so that we've always got types and struct attributes defined,
since kconfig.h is included from the compiler command line.
