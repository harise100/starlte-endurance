Subject: usb: gadget: f_fs: Process all descriptors during bind

From: Jack Pham <jackp@codeaurora.org>

commit 6cf439e0d37463e42784271179c8a308fd7493c6 upstream.

During _ffs_func_bind(), the received descriptors are evaluated
to prepare for binding with the gadget in order to allocate
endpoints and optionally set up OS descriptors. However, the
high- and super-speed descriptors are only parsed based on
whether the gadget_is_dualspeed() and gadget_is_superspeed()
calls are true, respectively.

This is a problem in case a userspace program always provides
all of the {full,high,super,OS} descriptors when configuring a
function. Then, for example if a gadget device is not capable
of SuperSpeed, the call to ffs_do_descs() for the SS descriptors
is skipped, resulting in an incorrect offset calculation for
the vla_ptr when moving on to the OS descriptors that follow.
This causes ffs_do_os_descs() to fail as it is now looking at
the SS descriptors' offset within the raw_descs buffer instead.

_ffs_func_bind() should evaluate the descriptors unconditionally,
so remove the checks for gadget speed.
