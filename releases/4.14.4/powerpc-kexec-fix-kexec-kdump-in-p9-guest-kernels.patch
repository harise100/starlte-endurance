Subject: powerpc/kexec: Fix kexec/kdump in P9 guest kernels

From: Michael Ellerman <mpe@ellerman.id.au>

commit 2621e945fbf1d6df5f3f0ba7be5bae3d2cf9b6a5 upstream.

The code that cleans up the IAMR/AMOR before kexec'ing failed to
remember that when we're running as a guest AMOR is not writable, it's
hypervisor privileged.

They symptom is that the kexec stops before entering purgatory and
nothing else is seen on the console. If you examine the state of the
system all threads will be in the 0x700 program check handler.

Fix it by making the write to AMOR dependent on HV mode.

Fixes: 1e2a516e89fc ("powerpc/kexec: Fix radix to hash kexec due to IAMR/AMOR")
