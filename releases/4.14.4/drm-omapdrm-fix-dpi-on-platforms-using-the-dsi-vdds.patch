Subject: drm: omapdrm: Fix DPI on platforms using the DSI VDDS

From: Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>

commit bf25dac38f71d392a31ec074f55cbc941f1eaf1d upstream.

Commit d178e034d565 ("drm: omapdrm: Move FEAT_DPI_USES_VDDS_DSI feature
to dpi code") replaced usage of platform data version with SoC matching
to configure DPI VDDS. The SoC match entries were incorrect, they should
have matched on the machine name instead of the SoC family. Fix it.

The result was observed on OpenPandora with OMAP3530 where the panel only
had the Blue channel and Red&Green were missing. It was not observed on
GTA04 with DM3730.
