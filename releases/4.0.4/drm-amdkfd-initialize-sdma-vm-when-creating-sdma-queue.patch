Subject: drm/amdkfd: Initialize sdma vm when creating sdma queue

From: Xihan Zhang <xihan.zhang@amd.com>

commit 79b066bd76d501cfe8328142153da301f5ca11d1 upstream.

This patch fixes a bug where sdma vm wasn't initialized when
an sdma queue was created in HWS mode.

This caused GPUVM faults to appear on dmesg and it is one of the
causes that SDMA queues are not working.
