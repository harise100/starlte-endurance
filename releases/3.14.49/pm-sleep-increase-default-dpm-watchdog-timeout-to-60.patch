Subject: PM / sleep: Increase default DPM watchdog timeout to 60

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit fff3b16d2754a061a3549c4307a186423a0128fd upstream.

Many harddisks (mostly WD ones) have firmware problems and take too
long, more than 10 seconds, to resume from suspend.  And this often
exceeds the default DPM watchdog timeout (12 seconds), resulting in a
kernel panic out of sudden.

Since most distros just take the default as is, we should give a bit
more safer value.  This patch increases the default value from 12
seconds to one minute, which has been confirmed to be long enough for
such problematic disks.
