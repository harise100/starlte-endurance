Subject: drm/qxl: Do not cause spice-server to clean our objects

From: Frediano Ziglio <fziglio@redhat.com>

commit 2fa19535ca6abcbfd1ccc9ef694db52f49f77747 upstream.

If objects are moved back from system memory to VRAM (and spice id
created again) memory is already initialized so we need to set flag
to not clear memory.
If you don't do it after a while using desktop many images turns to
black or transparents.
