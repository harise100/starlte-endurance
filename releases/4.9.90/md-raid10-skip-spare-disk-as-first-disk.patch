Subject: md/raid10: skip spare disk as 'first' disk

From: Shaohua Li <shli@fb.com>


[ Upstream commit b506335e5d2b4ec687dde392a3bdbf7601778f1d ]

Commit 6f287ca(md/raid10: reset the 'first' at the end of loop) ignores
a case in reshape, the first rdev could be a spare disk, which shouldn't
be accounted as the first disk since it doesn't include the offset info.

Fix: 6f287ca(md/raid10: reset the 'first' at the end of loop)
