Subject: Input: drv260x - fix input device's parent assignment

From: Jingkui Wang <jkwang@google.com>

commit 5a8a6b89c15766446d845671d574a9243b6d8786 upstream.

We were assigning I2C bus controller instead of client as parent device.
Besides being logically wrong, it messed up with devm handling of input
device. As a result we were leaving input device and event node behind
after rmmod-ing the driver, which lead to a kernel oops if one were to
access the event node later.

Let's remove the assignment and rely on devm_input_allocate_device() to
set it up properly for us.
