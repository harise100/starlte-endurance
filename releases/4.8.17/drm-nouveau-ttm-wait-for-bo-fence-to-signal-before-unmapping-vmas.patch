Subject: drm/nouveau/ttm: wait for bo fence to signal before unmapping vmas

From: Ben Skeggs <bskeggs@redhat.com>

commit 10dcab3e7f477bffee88d518aad57d06777cfdf4 upstream.

TTM was changed a while back to allow for pipelining of buffer moves, and
part of this was the removal of waiting for a BO to idle before calling
move(), placing the responsibility on the driver to do this if required.

That's all well and good, except, we make use of move_notify() to handle
mapping/unmapping from the GPU VMM as move() isn't called on all paths.

This commit adds a wait before unmapping from a VMM in move_notify(), to
prevent GPU page faults where a buffer is still being accessed.
