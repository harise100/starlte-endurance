commit e70dda0868fad0f74c46df21f7f45fec24f29879 upstream.

pci_read_config_word() might fail and not initialize its output,
as pointed out by older versions of gcc when using the -Wmaybe-unintialized
flag:

drivers/mtd/maps/ichxrom.c: In function ‘ichxrom_cleanup’:
drivers/mtd/maps/ichxrom.c:63:2: error: ‘word’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]

This is apparently a correct warning, though it does not show up
with newer compilers. Changing the code to not attempt to write
back uninitialized data into PCI config space is a correct
fix for the problem and avoids the warning.
