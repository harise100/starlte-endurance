Subject: workqueue: make sure MAYDAY_INITIAL_TIMEOUT is at least 2 jiffies long

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit 3233cdbd9fa347a6d6897a94cc6ed0302ae83c4f upstream.

MAYDAY_INITIAL_TIMEOUT is defined as HZ / 100 and depending on
configuration may end up 0 or 1.  Even when it's 1, depending on when
the mayday timer is added in the current jiffy interval, it may expire
way before a jiffy has passed.

Make sure MAYDAY_INITIAL_TIMEOUT is at least two to guarantee that at
least a full jiffy has passed before calling rescuers.
