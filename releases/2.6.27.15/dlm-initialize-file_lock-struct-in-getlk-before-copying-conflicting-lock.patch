Subject: dlm: initialize file_lock struct in GETLK before copying conflicting lock

From: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>

commit 20d5a39929232a715f29e6cb7e3f0d0c790f41eb upstream.

dlm_posix_get fills out the relevant fields in the file_lock before
returning when there is a lock conflict, but doesn't clean out any of
the other fields in the file_lock.

When nfsd does a NFSv4 lockt call, it sets the fl_lmops to
nfsd_posix_mng_ops before calling the lower fs. When the lock comes back
after testing a lock on GFS2, it still has that field set. This confuses
nfsd into thinking that the file_lock is a nfsd4 lock.

Fix this by making DLM reinitialize the file_lock before copying the
fields from the conflicting lock.
