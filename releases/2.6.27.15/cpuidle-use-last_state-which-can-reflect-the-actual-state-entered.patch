commit 887e301aa1105326f1412a98749024263b1031c7 upstream

cpuidle accounts the idle time for the C-state it was trying to enter and
not to the actual state that the driver eventually entered. The driver may
select a different state than the one chosen by cpuidle due to
constraints like bus-mastering, etc.

Change the time acounting code to look at the dev->last_state after
returning from target_state->enter(). Driver can modify dev->last_state
internally, inside the enter routine to reflect the actual C-state
entered.
