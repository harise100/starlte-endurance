Subject: USB: serial: ti_usb_3410_5052: Correct TUSB3410 endpoint requirements.

From: Robert Spanton <rspanton@zepler.net>

upstream commit: 1bfd6693cd66f1e79abce62d3e8c3647e1f59a55

The changes introduced in commit
063a2da8f01806906f7d7b1a1424b9afddebc443 changed the semantics of the
num_interrupt_in, num_interrupt_out, num_bulk_in and num_bulk_out
entries of the usb_serial_driver struct to be the number of endpoints
the device has when probed.

This patch changes the ti_1port_device usb_serial_driver struct to
reflect this change.  The single port devices only have 1
bulk_out endpoint in their initial configuration, and so this patch
changes the number of other types to NUM_DONT_CARE.

The same change probably needs doing to the ti_2port_device struct,
but I don't have a two port device at hand.
