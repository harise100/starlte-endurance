Subject: ext3: Always set dx_node's fake_dirent explicitly.

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

commit d7433142b63d727b5a217c37b1a1468b116a9771 upstream.

(crossport of 1f7bebb9e911d870fa8f997ddff838e82b5715ea
by Andreas Schlick <schlick@lavabit.com>)

When ext3_dx_add_entry() has to split an index node, it has to ensure that
name_len of dx_node's fake_dirent is also zero, because otherwise e2fsck
won't recognise it as an intermediate htree node and consider the htree to
be corrupted.
