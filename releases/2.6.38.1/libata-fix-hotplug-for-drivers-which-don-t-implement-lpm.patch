Subject: libata: fix hotplug for drivers which don't implement LPM

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit eb0e85e36b971ec31610eda7e3ff5c11c1c44785 upstream.

ata_eh_analyze_serror() suppresses hotplug notifications if LPM is
being used because LPM generates spurious hotplug events.  It compared
whether link->lpm_policy was different from ATA_LPM_MAX_POWER to
determine whether LPM is enabled; however, this is incorrect as for
drivers which don't implement LPM, lpm_policy is always
ATA_LPM_UNKNOWN.  This disabled hotplug detection for all drivers
which don't implement LPM.

Fix it by comparing whether lpm_policy is greater than
ATA_LPM_MAX_POWER.
