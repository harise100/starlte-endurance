Subject: bcache: ret IOERR when read meets metadata error

From: Rui Hua <huarui.dev@gmail.com>


[ Upstream commit b221fc130c49c50f4c2250d22e873420765a9fa2 ]

The read request might meet error when searching the btree, but the error
was not handled in cache_lookup(), and this kind of metadata failure will
not go into cached_dev_read_error(), finally, the upper layer will receive
bi_status=0.  In this patch we judge the metadata error by the return
value of bch_btree_map_keys(), there are two potential paths give rise to
the error:

1. Because the btree is not totally cached in memery, we maybe get error
   when read btree node from cache device (see bch_btree_node_get()), the
   likely errno is -EIO, -ENOMEM

2. When read miss happens, bch_btree_insert_check_key() will be called to
   insert a "replace_key" to btree(see cached_dev_cache_miss(), just for
   doing preparatory work before insert the missed data to cache device),
   a failure can also happen in this situation, the likely errno is
   -ENOMEM

bch_btree_map_keys() will return MAP_DONE in normal scenario, but we will
get either -EIO or -ENOMEM in above two cases. if this happened, we should
NOT recover data from backing device (when cache device is dirty) because
we don't know whether bkeys the read request covered are all clean.  And
after that happened, s->iop.status is still its initially value(0) before
we submit s->bio.bio, we set it to BLK_STS_IOERR, so it can go into
cached_dev_read_error(), and finally it can be passed to upper layer, or
recovered by reread from backing device.
