Subject: USB: unbind all interfaces before rebinding them

commit c043f1245654a726925529007210e9f786426448 upstream.

This patch (as1387) fixes a bug introduced during the changeover to
the runtime PM framework.  When a driver doesn't support resume or
reset-resume, and consequently its interfaces need to be unbound and
rebound, we have to unbind all the interfaces before trying to rebind
any of them.  Otherwise the driver's probe method for one interface
could try to claim a different interface and fail, because that other
interface hasn't been unbound yet.

This fixes Bugzilla #15788.  The symptom is that some USB sound cards
don't work after hibernation.
