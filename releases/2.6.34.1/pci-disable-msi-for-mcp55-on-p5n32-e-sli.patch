Subject: PCI: Disable MSI for MCP55 on P5N32-E SLI

From: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>

commit e4146bb9088c01c8b6e82be11f0c371f8aff023c upstream.

As reported in <http://bugs.debian.org/552299>, MSI appears to be
broken for this on-board device.  We already have a quirk for the
P5N32-SLI Premium; extend it to cover both variants of the board.
