Subject: vfs: Ignore unlocked mounts in fs_fully_visible

From: "Eric W. Biederman" <ebiederm@xmission.com>

commit ceeb0e5d39fcdf4dca2c997bf225c7fc49200b37 upstream.

Limit the mounts fs_fully_visible considers to locked mounts.
Unlocked can always be unmounted so considering them adds hassle
but no security benefit.
