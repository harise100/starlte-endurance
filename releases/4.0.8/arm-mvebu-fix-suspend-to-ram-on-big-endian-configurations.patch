Subject: ARM: mvebu: fix suspend to RAM on big-endian configurations

From: Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@free-electrons.com>

commit 2f5bc307be2480ba89e4c5d118f406f04a4a7299 upstream.

The current Armada XP suspend to RAM implementation, as added in
commit 27432825ae19f ("ARM: mvebu: Armada XP GP specific
suspend/resume code") does not handle big-endian configurations
properly: the small bit of assembly code putting the DRAM in
self-refresh and toggling the GPIOs to turn off power forgets to
convert the values to little-endian.

This commit fixes that by making sure the two values we will write to
the DRAM controller register and GPIO register are already in
little-endian before entering the critical assembly code.
