Subject: ntp: Correct TAI offset during leap second

From: Richard Cochran <richardcochran@gmail.com>

commit dd48d708ff3e917f6d6b6c2b696c3f18c019feed upstream.

When repeating a UTC time value during a leap second (when the UTC
time should be 23:59:60), the TAI timescale should not stop. The kernel
NTP code increments the TAI offset one second too late. This patch fixes
the issue by incrementing the offset during the leap second itself.
