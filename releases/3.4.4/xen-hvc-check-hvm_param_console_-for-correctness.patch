Subject: xen/hvc: Check HVM_PARAM_CONSOLE_[EVTCHN|PFN] for correctness.

From: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>

commit 5842f5768599094758931b74190cdf93641a8e35 upstream.

We need to make sure that those parameters are setup to be correct.
As such the value of 0 is deemed invalid and we find that we
bail out. The hypervisor sets by default all of them to be zero
and when the hypercall is done does a simple:

 a.value = d->arch.hvm_domain.params[a.index];

Which means that if the Xen toolstack forgot to setup the proper
HVM_PARAM_CONSOLE_EVTCHN (or the PFN one), we would get the
default value of 0 and use that.
