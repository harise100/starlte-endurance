Subject: ACPI: Clear WAK_STS on resume

commit a68823ee5285e65b51ceb96f8b13a5b4f99a6888 upstream.

ACPI: Clear WAK_STS on resume

The leading other brand OS appears to clear the WAK_STS flag on resume.
When rebooted, certain BIOSes assume that the system is actually
resuming if it's still set and so fail to reboot correctly. Make sure
that it's cleared at resume time.
