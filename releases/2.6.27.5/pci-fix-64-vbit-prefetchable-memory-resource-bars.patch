Subject: PCI: fix 64-vbit prefetchable memory resource BARs

From: Peter Chubb <peterc@gelato.unsw.edu.au>

commit e354597cce8d219d135d65e585dc4f30323486b9 upstream.

Since patch 6ac665c63dcac8fcec534a1d224ecbb8b867ad59 my infiniband
controller hasn't worked.  This is because it has 64-bit prefetchable
memory, which was mistakenly being  taken to be 32-bit memory.  The
resource flags in this case are PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64 |
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_PREFETCH.

This patch checks only for the PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64 bit; thus
whether the region is prefetchable or not is ignored.  This fixes my
Infiniband.
