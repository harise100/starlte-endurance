Subject: ARM: 7355/1: perf: clear overflow flag when disabling counter on ARMv7 PMU

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

commit 99c1745b9c76910e195889044f914b4898b7c9a5 upstream.

When disabling a counter on an ARMv7 PMU, we should also clear the
overflow flag in case an overflow occurred whilst stopping the counter.
This prevents a spurious overflow being picked up later and leading to
either false accounting or a NULL dereference.
