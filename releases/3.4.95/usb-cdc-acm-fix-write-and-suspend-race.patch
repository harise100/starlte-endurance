Subject: USB: cdc-acm: fix write and suspend race

From: Johan Hovold <jhovold@gmail.com>

commit 5a345c20c17d87099224a4be12e69e5bd7023dca upstream.

Fix race between write() and suspend() which could lead to writes being
dropped (or I/O while suspended) if the device is runtime suspended
while a write request is being processed.

Specifically, suspend() releases the write_lock after determining the
device is idle but before incrementing the susp_count, thus leaving a
window where a concurrent write() can submit an urb.

Fixes: 11ea859d64b6 ("USB: additional power savings for cdc-acm devices
that support remote wakeup")
