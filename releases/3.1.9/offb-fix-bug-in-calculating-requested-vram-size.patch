Subject: offb: Fix bug in calculating requested vram size

From: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>

commit c055fe0797b7bd8f6f21a13598a55a16d5c13ae7 upstream.

We used to try to request 8 times more vram than needed, which would
fail if the card has a too small BAR (observed with qemu & kvm).
