Subject: ALSA: hda - Don't reset HP pinctl in patch_sigmatel.c

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 8317e0b0c2234f5f1f5d54804e4093d11bc0dffa upstream.

Resetting HP pinctl at the unplugged state may cause a sort of regression
on some devices because of their wrong pin configuration.

A simple workaround is to disable the pin reset.  This is ugly and may be
not good from the power-saving POV (if any), but damn simple.
