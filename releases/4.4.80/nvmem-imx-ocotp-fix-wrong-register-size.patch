Subject: nvmem: imx-ocotp: Fix wrong register size

From: Daniel Schultz <d.schultz@phytec.de>


[ Upstream commit 14ba972842f9e84e6d3264bc0302101b8a792288 ]

All i.MX6 SoCs have an OCOTP Controller with 4kbit fuses. The i.MX6SL is
an exception and has only 2kbit fuses.

In the TRM for the i.MX6DQ (IMX6QDRM - Rev 2, 06/2014) the fuses size is
described in chapter 46.1.1 with:
"32-bit word restricted program and read to 4Kbits of eFuse OTP(512x8)."

In the TRM for the i.MX6SL (IMX6SLRM - Rev 2, 06/2015) the fuses size is
described in chapter 34.1.1 with:
"32-bit word restricted program and read to 2 kbit of eFuse OTP(128x8)."

Since the Freescale Linux kernel OCOTP driver works with a fuses size of
2 kbit for the i.MX6SL, it looks like the TRM is wrong and the formula
to calculate the correct fuses size has to be 256x8.
