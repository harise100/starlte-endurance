Subject: [CPUFREQ] Enable ACPI PDC handshake for VIA/Centaur CPUs

From: Harald Welte <HaraldWelte@viatech.com>

commit d77b81974521c82fa6fda38dfff1b491dcc62a32 upstream.

In commit 0de51088e6a82bc8413d3ca9e28bbca2788b5b53, we introduced the
use of acpi-cpufreq on VIA/Centaur CPU's by removing a vendor check for
VENDOR_INTEL.  However, as it turns out, at least the Nano CPU's also
need the PDC (processor driver capabilities) handshake in order to
activate the methods required for acpi-cpufreq.

Since arch_acpi_processor_init_pdc() contains another vendor check for
Intel, the PDC is not initialized on VIA CPU's.  The resulting behavior
of a current mainline kernel on such systems is:  acpi-cpufreq
loads and it indicates CPU frequency changes.  However, the CPU stays at
a single frequency

This trivial patch ensures that init_intel_pdc() is called on Intel and
VIA/Centaur CPU's alike.
