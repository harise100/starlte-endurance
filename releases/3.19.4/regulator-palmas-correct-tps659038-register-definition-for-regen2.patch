Subject: regulator: palmas: Correct TPS659038 register definition for REGEN2

From: Keerthy <j-keerthy@ti.com>

commit e03826d5045e81a66a4fad7be9a8ecdaeb7911cf upstream.

The register offset for REGEN2_CTRL in different for TPS659038 chip as when
compared with other Palmas family PMICs. In the case of TPS659038 the wrong
offset pointed to PLLEN_CTRL and was causing a hang. Correcting the same.
