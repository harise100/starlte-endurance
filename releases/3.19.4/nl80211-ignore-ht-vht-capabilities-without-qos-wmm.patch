Subject: nl80211: ignore HT/VHT capabilities without QoS/WMM

From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

commit 496fcc294daab18799e190c0264863d653588d1f upstream.

As HT/VHT depend heavily on QoS/WMM, it's not a good idea to
let userspace add clients that have HT/VHT but not QoS/WMM.
Since it does so in certain cases we've observed (client is
using HT IEs but not QoS/WMM) just ignore the HT/VHT info at
this point and don't pass it down to the drivers which might
unconditionally use it.
