Subject: Input: synaptics - query min dimensions for fw v8.1

From: Daniel Martin <consume.noise@gmail.com>

commit ac097930f0730a9b777737de2b51e0fc49d2be7a upstream.

Query the min dimensions even if the check
SYN_EXT_CAP_REQUESTS(priv->capabilities) >= 7 fails, but we know that the
firmware version 8.1 is safe.

With that we don't need quirks for post-2013 models anymore as they expose
correct min and max dimensions.
