Subject: Revert "ARM: dts: am335x-pepper: Fix the audio CODEC's reset pin"

From: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>

This reverts commit 2d8c5aa6dc436f6fc1c8b6c0feaee4b0f60cdf38 which was
comit e153db03c6b7a035c797bcdf35262586f003ee93 upstream.

It requires a driver that was not merged until 4.16, so remove it from
this stable tree as it is pointless.
