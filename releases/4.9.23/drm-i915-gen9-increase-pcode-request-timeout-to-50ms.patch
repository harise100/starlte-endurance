    drm/i915/gen9: Fix PCODE polling during CDCLK change notification

there is still one report of the CDCLK-change request timing out on a
KBL machine, see the Reference link. On that machine the maximum time
the request took to succeed was 34ms, so increase the timeout to 50ms.

v2:
- Change timeout from 100 to 50 ms to maintain the current 50 ms limit
  for atomic waits in the driver. (Chris, Tvrtko)
