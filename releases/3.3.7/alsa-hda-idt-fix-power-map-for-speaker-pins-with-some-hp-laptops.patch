Subject: ALSA: hda/idt - Fix power-map for speaker-pins with some HP laptops

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit b0791dda813c179e539b0fc1ecd3f5f30f2571e2 upstream.

BIOS on some HP laptops don't set the speaker-pins as fixed but expose
as jacks, and this confuses the driver as if these pins are
jack-detectable.  As a result, the machine doesn't get sounds from
speakers because the driver prepares the power-map update via jack
unsol events which never come up in reality.  The bug was introduced
in some time in 3.2 for enabling the power-mapping feature.

This patch fixes the problem by replacing the check of the persistent
power-map bits with a proper is_jack_detectable() call.
