Subject: x86/fpu: Fix 32-bit signal frame handling

From: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen@linux.intel.com>

commit ab6b52947545a5355154f64f449f97af9d05845f upstream.

(This should have gone to LKML originally. Sorry for the extra
 noise, folks on the cc.)

Background:

Signal frames on x86 have two formats:

  1. For 32-bit executables (whether on a real 32-bit kernel or
     under 32-bit emulation on a 64-bit kernel) we have a
    'fpregset_t' that includes the "FSAVE" registers.

  2. For 64-bit executables (on 64-bit kernels obviously), the
     'fpregset_t' is smaller and does not contain the "FSAVE"
     state.

When creating the signal frame, we have to be aware of whether
we are running a 32 or 64-bit executable so we create the
correct format signal frame.

Problem:

save_xstate_epilog() uses 'fx_sw_reserved_ia32' whenever it is
called for a 32-bit executable.  This is for real 32-bit and
ia32 emulation.

But, fpu__init_prepare_fx_sw_frame() only initializes
'fx_sw_reserved_ia32' when emulation is enabled, *NOT* for real
32-bit kernels.

This leads to really wierd situations where 32-bit programs
lose their extended state when returning from a signal handler.
The kernel copies the uninitialized (zero) 'fx_sw_reserved_ia32'
out to userspace in save_xstate_epilog().  But when returning
from the signal, the kernel errors out in check_for_xstate()
when it does not see FP_XSTATE_MAGIC1 present (because it was
zeroed).  This leads to the FPU/XSAVE state being initialized.

For MPX, this leads to the most permissive state and means we
silently lose bounds violations.  I think this would also mean
that we could lose *ANY* FPU/SSE/AVX state.  I'm not sure why
no one has spotted this bug.

I believe this was broken by:

	72a671ced66d ("x86, fpu: Unify signal handling code paths for x86 and x86_64 kernels")

way back in 2012.
