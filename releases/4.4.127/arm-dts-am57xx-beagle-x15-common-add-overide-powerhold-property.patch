Subject: ARM: dts: am57xx-beagle-x15-common: Add overide powerhold property

From: Keerthy <j-keerthy@ti.com>

commit 1f166499ce006b3770a3166122eda64e160736ab upstream.

The PMICs have POWERHOLD set by default which prevents PMIC shutdown
even on DEV_CTRL On bit set to 0 as the Powerhold has higher priority.
So to enable pmic power off this property lets one over ride the default
value and enable pmic power off.
