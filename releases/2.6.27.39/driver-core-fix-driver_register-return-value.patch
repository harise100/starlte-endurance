Subject: Driver core: fix driver_register() return value

From: Stas Sergeev <stsp@aknet.ru>

commit 39acbc12affcaa23ef1d887ba3d197baca8e6e47 upstream.

In this patch:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=16dc42e018c2868211b4928f20a957c0c216126c
the check was added for another driver to already claim the same device
on the same bus. But the returned error code was wrong: to modprobe, the
-EEXIST means that _this_ driver is already installed. It therefore
doesn't produce the needed error message when _another_ driver is trying
to register for the same device.  Returning -EBUSY fixes the problem.
