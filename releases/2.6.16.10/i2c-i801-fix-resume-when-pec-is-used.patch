Subject: i2c-i801: Fix resume when PEC is used

Fix for bug #6395:
Fail to resume on Tecra M2 with ADM1032 and Intel 82801DBM

The BIOS of the Tecra M2 doesn't like it when it has to reboot or
resume after the i2c-i801 driver has left the SMBus in PEC mode.
I have a more complete fix for 2.6.17 but the simple approach of
leaving the SMBus in non-PEC mode after every transaction should do
for -stable. That's what the i2c-i801 driver was doing up to 2.6.15
(inclusive).
