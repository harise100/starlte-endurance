Subject: ext4: don't allow r/w mounts if metadata blocks overlap the superblock

From: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>

commit 18db4b4e6fc31eda838dd1c1296d67dbcb3dc957 upstream.

If some metadata block, such as an allocation bitmap, overlaps the
superblock, it's very likely that if the file system is mounted
read/write, the results will not be pretty.  So disallow r/w mounts
for file systems corrupted in this particular way.

Backport notes:
3.18.y is missing bc98a42c1f7d ("VFS: Convert sb->s_flags & MS_RDONLY to sb_rdonly(sb)")
and e462ec50cb5f ("VFS: Differentiate mount flags (MS_*) from internal superblock flags")
so we simply use the sb MS_RDONLY check from pre bc98a42c1f7d in place of the sb_rdonly
function used in the upstream variant of the patch.
