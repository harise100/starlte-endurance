Subject: dmaengine: at_xdmac: fix rare residue corruption

From: Maxime Jayat <maxime.jayat@mobile-devices.fr>

commit c5637476bbf9bb86c7f0413b8f4822a73d8d2d07 upstream.

Despite the efforts made to correctly read the NDA and CUBC registers,
the order in which the registers are read could sometimes lead to an
inconsistent state.

Re-using the timeline from the comments, this following timing of
registers reads could lead to reading NDA with value "@desc2" and
CUBC with value "MAX desc1":

 INITD --------                    ------------
              |____________________|
       _______________________  _______________
 NDA       @desc2             \/   @desc3
       _______________________/\_______________
       __________  ___________  _______________
 CUBC       0    \/ MAX desc1 \/  MAX desc2
       __________/\___________/\_______________
        |  |          |  |
Events:(1)(2)        (3)(4)

(1) check_nda = @desc2
(2) initd = 1
(3) cur_ubc = MAX desc1
(4) cur_nda = @desc2

This is allowed by the condition ((check_nda == cur_nda) && initd),
despite cur_ubc and cur_nda being in the precise state we don't want.

This error leads to incorrect residue computation.

Fix it by inversing the order in which CUBC and INITD are read. This
makes sure that NDA and CUBC are always read together either _before_
INITD goes to 0 or _after_ it is back at 1.
The case where NDA is read before INITD is at 0 and CUBC is read after
INITD is back at 1 will be rejected by check_nda and cur_nda being
different.
