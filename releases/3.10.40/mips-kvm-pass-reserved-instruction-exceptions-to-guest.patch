Subject: MIPS: KVM: Pass reserved instruction exceptions to guest

From: James Hogan <james.hogan@imgtec.com>

commit 15505679362270d02c449626385cb74af8905514 upstream.

Previously a reserved instruction exception while in guest code would
cause a KVM internal error if kvm_mips_handle_ri() didn't recognise the
instruction (including a RDHWR from an unrecognised hardware register).

However the guest OS should really have the opportunity to catch the
exception so that it can take the appropriate actions such as sending a
SIGILL to the guest user process or emulating the instruction itself.

Therefore in these cases emulate a guest RI exception and only return
EMULATE_FAIL if that fails, being careful to revert the PC first in case
the exception occurred in a branch delay slot in which case the PC will
already point to the branch target.

Also turn the printk messages relating to these cases into kvm_debug
messages so that they aren't usually visible.

This allows crashme to run in the guest without killing the entire VM.
