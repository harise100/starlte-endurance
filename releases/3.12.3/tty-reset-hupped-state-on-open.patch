Subject: tty: Reset hupped state on open

From: Peter Hurley <peter@hurleysoftware.com>

commit d4855e1fc03c2bb32dd64badf51cec5a2a26ab2a upstream.

A common security idiom is to hangup the current tty (via vhangup())
after forking but before execing a root shell. This hangs up any
existing opens which other processes may have and ensures subsequent
opens have the necessary permissions to open the root shell tty/pty.

Reset the TTY_HUPPED state after the driver has successfully
returned the opened tty (perform the reset while the tty is locked
to avoid racing with concurrent hangups).
