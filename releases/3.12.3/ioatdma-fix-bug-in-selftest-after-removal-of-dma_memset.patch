Subject: ioatdma: Fix bug in selftest after removal of DMA_MEMSET.

From: Dave Jiang <dave.jiang@intel.com>

commit ac7d631f7d9f9e4e6116c4a72b6308067d0a2226 upstream.

Commit 48a9db4 (3.11) removed the memset op in the xor selftest for ioatdma.
The issue is that with the removal of that op, it never replaced the memset
with a CPU memset. The memory being operated on is expected to be zeroes but
was not. This is causing the xor selftest to fail.
