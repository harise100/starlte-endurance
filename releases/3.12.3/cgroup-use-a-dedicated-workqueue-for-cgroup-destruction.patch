Subject: cgroup: use a dedicated workqueue for cgroup destruction

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit e5fca243abae1445afbfceebda5f08462ef869d3 upstream.

Since be44562613851 ("cgroup: remove synchronize_rcu() from
cgroup_diput()"), cgroup destruction path makes use of workqueue.  css
freeing is performed from a work item from that point on and a later
commit, ea15f8ccdb430 ("cgroup: split cgroup destruction into two
steps"), moves css offlining to workqueue too.

As cgroup destruction isn't depended upon for memory reclaim, the
destruction work items were put on the system_wq; unfortunately, some
controller may block in the destruction path for considerable duration
while holding cgroup_mutex.  As large part of destruction path is
synchronized through cgroup_mutex, when combined with high rate of
cgroup removals, this has potential to fill up system_wq's max_active
of 256.

Also, it turns out that memcg's css destruction path ends up queueing
and waiting for work items on system_wq through work_on_cpu().  If
such operation happens while system_wq is fully occupied by cgroup
destruction work items, work_on_cpu() can't make forward progress
because system_wq is full and other destruction work items on
system_wq can't make forward progress because the work item waiting
for work_on_cpu() is holding cgroup_mutex, leading to deadlock.

This can be fixed by queueing destruction work items on a separate
workqueue.  This patch creates a dedicated workqueue -
cgroup_destroy_wq - for this purpose.  As these work items shouldn't
have inter-dependencies and mostly serialized by cgroup_mutex anyway,
giving high concurrency level doesn't buy anything and the workqueue's
@max_active is set to 1 so that destruction work items are executed
one by one on each CPU.

Hugh Dickins: Because cgroup_init() is run before init_workqueues(),
cgroup_destroy_wq can't be allocated from cgroup_init().  Do it from a
separate core_initcall().  In the future, we probably want to reorder
so that workqueue init happens before cgroup_init().
