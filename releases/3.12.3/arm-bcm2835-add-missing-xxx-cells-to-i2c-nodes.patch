Subject: ARM: bcm2835: add missing #xxx-cells to I2C nodes

From: Stephen Warren <swarren@wwwdotorg.org>

commit a31ab44ef5d07c6707df4a9ad2c8affd2d62ff4b upstream.

The I2C controller node needs #address-cells and #size-cells properties,
but these are currently missing. Add them. This allows child nodes to be
parsed correctly.
