Subject: USB: pl2303: fix baud-rate divisor calculations

From: =?UTF-8?q?Micha=C5=82=20Pecio?= <michal.pecio@gmail.com>

commit 49bda21266fdf195142e8b5dea057f09e96ada9f upstream.

This commit fixes the following issues:

1. The 9th bit of buf was believed to be the LSB of divisor's
exponent, but the hardware interprets it as MSB (9th bit) of the
mantissa. The exponent is actually one bit shorter and applies
to base 4, not 2 as previously believed.

2. Loop iterations doubled the exponent instead of incrementing.

3. The exponent wasn't checked for overflow.

4. The function returned requested rate instead of actual rate.

Due to issue #2, the old code deviated from the wrong formula
described in #1 and actually yielded correct rates when divisor
was lower than 4096 by using exponents of 0, 2 or 4 base-2,
interpreted as 0, 1, 2 base-4 with the 9th mantissa bit clear.
However, at 93.75 kbaud or less the rate turned out too slow
due to #2 or too fast due to #2 and #3.

I tested this patch by sending and validating 0x00,0x01,..,0xff
to an FTDI dongle at 234, 987, 2401, 9601, 31415, 115199, 250k,
500k, 750k, 1M, 1.5M, 3M+1 baud. All rates passed.

I also used pv to check speed at some rates unsupported by FTDI:
45 (the lowest possible), 2M, 4M, 5M and 6M-1. Looked sane.
