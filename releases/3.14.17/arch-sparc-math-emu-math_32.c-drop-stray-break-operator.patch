Subject: arch/sparc/math-emu/math_32.c: drop stray break operator

From: Andrey Utkin <andrey.krieger.utkin@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 093758e3daede29cb4ce6aedb111becf9d4bfc57 ]

This commit is a guesswork, but it seems to make sense to drop this
break, as otherwise the following line is never executed and becomes
dead code. And that following line actually saves the result of
local calculation by the pointer given in function argument. So the
proposed change makes sense if this code in the whole makes sense (but I
am unable to analyze it in the whole).
