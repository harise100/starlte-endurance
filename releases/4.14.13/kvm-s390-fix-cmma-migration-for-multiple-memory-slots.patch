Subject: KVM: s390: fix cmma migration for multiple memory slots

From: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>

commit 32aa144fc32abfcbf7140f473dfbd94c5b9b4105 upstream.

When multiple memory slots are present the cmma migration code
does not allocate enough memory for the bitmap. The memory slots
are sorted in reverse order, so we must use gfn and size of
slot[0] instead of the last one.
