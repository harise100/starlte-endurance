Subject: macvlan: filter out unsupported feature flags

From: Shannon Nelson <shannon.nelson@oracle.com>


[ Upstream commit 13fbcc8dc573482dd3f27568257fd7087f8935f4 ]

Adding a macvlan device on top of a lowerdev that supports
the xfrm offloads fails with a new regression:
  # ip link add link ens1f0 mv0 type macvlan
  RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted

Tracing down the failure shows that the macvlan device inherits
the NETIF_F_HW_ESP and NETIF_F_HW_ESP_TX_CSUM feature flags
from the lowerdev, but with no dev->xfrmdev_ops API filled
in, it doesn't actually support xfrm.  When the request is
made to add the new macvlan device, the XFRM listener for
NETDEV_REGISTER calls xfrm_api_check() which fails the new
registration because dev->xfrmdev_ops is NULL.

The macvlan creation succeeds when we filter out the ESP
feature flags in macvlan_fix_features(), so let's filter them
out like we're already filtering out ~NETIF_F_NETNS_LOCAL.
When XFRM support is added in the future, we can add the flags
into MACVLAN_FEATURES.

This same problem could crop up in the future with any other
new feature flags, so let's filter out any flags that aren't
defined as supported in macvlan.
