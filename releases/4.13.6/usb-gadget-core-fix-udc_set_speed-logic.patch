Subject: usb: gadget: core: fix ->udc_set_speed() logic

From: Roger Quadros <rogerq@ti.com>

commit 97e133d54c1ca8948b191e5721a145a76c4db33d upstream.

Consider the following case: udc controller supports SuperSpeed.  If we
first load a HighSpeed gadget followed by a SuperSpeed gadget, the
SuperSpeed gadget will be limited to HighSpeed as UDC core driver
doesn't call ->udc_set_speed() in the second case.

Call ->udc_set_speed() unconditionally to fix this issue.

This will also fix the case for dwc3 controller driver when SuperSpeed
gadget is loaded first and works in HighSpeed only as udc_set_speed()
was never being called.
