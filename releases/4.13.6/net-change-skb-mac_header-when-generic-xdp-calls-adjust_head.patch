Subject: net: change skb->mac_header when Generic XDP calls adjust_head

From: Edward Cree <ecree@solarflare.com>


[ Upstream commit 92dd5452c1be873a1193561f4f691763103d22ac ]

Since XDP's view of the packet includes the MAC header, moving the start-
 of-packet with bpf_xdp_adjust_head needs to also update the offset of the
 MAC header (which is relative to skb->head, not to the skb->data that was
 changed).
Without this, tcpdump sees packets starting from the old MAC header rather
 than the new one, at least in my tests on the loopback device.
