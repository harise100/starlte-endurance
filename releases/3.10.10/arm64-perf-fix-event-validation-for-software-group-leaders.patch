Subject: arm64: perf: fix event validation for software group leaders

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

commit ee7538a008a45050c8f706d38b600f55953169f9 upstream.

This is a port of c95eb3184ea1 ("ARM: 7809/1: perf: fix event validation
for software group leaders") to arm64, which fixes a panic in the arm64
perf backend found as a result of Vince's fuzzing tool.
