Subject: ALSA: hda - Don't power up when not powered down.

From: Dylan Reid <dgreid@chromium.org>

commit b43d224767e426cf1a8b6622d1d172f2b2b0e857 upstream.

After cancel_delayed_work_sync returns, the power down work either never
started (power_on == 1) or finished (power_on == 0).  In the former case
there is no need to power up again.
