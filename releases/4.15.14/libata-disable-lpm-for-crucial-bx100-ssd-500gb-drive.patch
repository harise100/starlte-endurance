Subject: libata: disable LPM for Crucial BX100 SSD 500GB drive

From: Kai-Heng Feng <kai.heng.feng@canonical.com>

commit b17e5729a630d8326a48ec34ef02e6b4464a6aef upstream.

out Crucial BX100 SSD can't get mounted.

Crucial BX100 SSD 500GB drive don't work well with min_power. This also
happens to med_power_with_dipm.

So let's disable LPM for Crucial BX100 SSD 500GB drive.
