Subject: drm: Schedule the output_poll_work with 1s delay if we have delayed event

From: Peter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@ti.com>

commit 68f458eec7069d618a6c884ca007426e0cea411b upstream.

Instead of scheduling the work to handle the initial delayed event, use 1s
delay.

This delay should not be needed, but Optimus/nouveau will fail in a
mysterious way if the delayed event is handled as soon as possible like it
is done in drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes() in case the poll
was enabled before.

Reverting 339fd36238dd would give back the 10 sec (!) delay to handle the
delayed event. Adding 1sec delay to the poll_work is enough to work around
the issue in Optimus setups and gives shorter response on handling the
initial delayed event.

Fixes: 339fd36238dd ("drm: drm_probe_helper: Fix output_poll_work scheduling")
