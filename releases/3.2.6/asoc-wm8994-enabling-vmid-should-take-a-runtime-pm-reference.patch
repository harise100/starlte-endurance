Subject: ASoC: wm8994: Enabling VMID should take a runtime PM reference

From: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

commit db966f8abb9ba74f7d5a7230f51572f52c31c4e5 upstream.

We can enable VMID independently of the bias in some use cases so we need
to ensure that the core device is powered up.
