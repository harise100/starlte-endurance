commit 3530febb5c7636f6b26d15637f68296804d26491 upstream.

This reverts commit 7290006d8c0900c56d8c58428134f02c35109d17.

Through the regression report, it was revealed that the
tpacpi_led_set() call to thinkpad_acpi helper doesn't only toggle the
mute LED but actually mutes the sound.  This is contradiction to the
expectation, and rather confuses user.

According to Henrique, it's not trivial to judge which TP model
behaves "LED-only" and which model does whatever more intrusive, as
Lenovo's implementations vary model by model.  So, from the safety
reason, we should revert the patch for now.
