Subject: md/raid5: don't record new size if resize_stripes fails.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 6e9eac2dcee5e19f125967dd2be3e36558c42fff upstream.

If any memory allocation in resize_stripes fails we will return
-ENOMEM, but in some cases we update conf->pool_size anyway.

This means that if we try again, the allocations will be assumed
to be larger than they are, and badness results.

So only update pool_size if there is no error.

This bug was introduced in 2.6.17 and the patch is suitable for
-stable.

Fixes: ad01c9e3752f ("[PATCH] md: Allow stripes to be expanded in preparation for expanding an array")
