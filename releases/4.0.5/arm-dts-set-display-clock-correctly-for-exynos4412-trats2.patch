Subject: ARM: dts: set display clock correctly for exynos4412-trats2

From: Inki Dae <inki.dae@samsung.com>

commit 242ddf04297f2c4768bd8eb7593ab911910c5f76 upstream.

This patch sets display clock correctly. If Display clock isn't set
correctly then you would find below messages and Display controller
doesn't work correctly.

 exynos-drm: No connectors reported connected with modes
 [drm] Cannot find any crtc or sizes - going 1024x768

Fixes: abc0b1447d49 ("drm: Perform basic sanity checks on probed modes")
