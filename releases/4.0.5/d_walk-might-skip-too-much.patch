Subject: d_walk() might skip too much

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

commit 2159184ea01e4ae7d15f2017e296d4bc82d5aeb0 upstream.

when we find that a child has died while we'd been trying to ascend,
we should go into the first live sibling itself, rather than its sibling.

Off-by-one in question had been introduced in "deal with deadlock in
d_walk()" and the fix needs to be backported to all branches this one
has been backported to.
