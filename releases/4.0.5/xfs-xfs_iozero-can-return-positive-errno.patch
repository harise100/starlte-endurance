Subject: xfs: xfs_iozero can return positive errno

From: Dave Chinner <dchinner@redhat.com>

commit cddc116228cb9d51d3224d23ba3e61fbbc3ec3d2 upstream.

It was missed when we converted everything in XFs to use negative error
numbers, so fix it now. Bug introduced in 3.17 by commit 2451337 ("xfs: global
error sign conversion"), and should go back to stable kernels.

Thanks to Brian Foster for noticing it.
