Subject: lock_parent() needs to recheck if dentry got __dentry_kill'ed under it

From: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

commit 3b821409632ab778d46e807516b457dfa72736ed upstream.

In case when dentry passed to lock_parent() is protected from freeing only
by the fact that it's on a shrink list and trylock of parent fails, we
could get hit by __dentry_kill() (and subsequent dentry_kill(parent))
between unlocking dentry and locking presumed parent.  We need to recheck
that dentry is alive once we lock both it and parent *and* postpone
rcu_read_unlock() until after that point.  Otherwise we could return
a pointer to struct dentry that already is rcu-scheduled for freeing, with
->d_lock held on it; caller's subsequent attempt to unlock it can end
up with memory corruption.
