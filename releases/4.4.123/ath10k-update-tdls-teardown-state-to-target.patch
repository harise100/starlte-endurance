Subject: ath10k: update tdls teardown state to target

From: Manikanta Pubbisetty <mpubbise@qti.qualcomm.com>


[ Upstream commit 424ea0d174e82365f85c6770225dba098b8f1d5f ]

It is required to update the teardown state of the peer when
a tdls link with that peer is terminated. This information is
useful for the target to perform some cleanups wrt the tdls peer.

Without proper cleanup, target assumes that the peer is connected and
blocks future connection requests, updating the teardown state of the
peer addresses the problem.

Tested this change on QCA9888 with 10.4-3.5.1-00018 fw version.
