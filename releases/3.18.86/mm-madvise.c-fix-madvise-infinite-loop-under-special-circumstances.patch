Subject: mm/madvise.c: fix madvise() infinite loop under special circumstances

From: chenjie <chenjie6@huawei.com>

commit 6ea8d958a2c95a1d514015d4e29ba21a8c0a1a91 upstream.

MADVISE_WILLNEED has always been a noop for DAX (formerly XIP) mappings.
Unfortunately madvise_willneed() doesn't communicate this information
properly to the generic madvise syscall implementation.  The calling
convention is quite subtle there.  madvise_vma() is supposed to either
return an error or update &prev otherwise the main loop will never
advance to the next vma and it will keep looping for ever without a way
to get out of the kernel.

It seems this has been broken since introduction.  Nobody has noticed
because nobody seems to be using MADVISE_WILLNEED on these DAX mappings.
