Subject: tracing: Fix panic when lseek() called on "trace" opened for writing

From: Slava Pestov <slavapestov@google.com>

commit 364829b1263b44aa60383824e4c1289d83d78ca7 upstream.

The file_ops struct for the "trace" special file defined llseek as seq_lseek().
However, if the file was opened for writing only, seq_open() was not called,
and the seek would dereference a null pointer, file->private_data.

This patch introduces a new wrapper for seq_lseek() which checks if the file
descriptor is opened for reading first. If not, it does nothing.
