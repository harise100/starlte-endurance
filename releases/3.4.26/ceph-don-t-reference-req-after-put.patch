Subject: ceph: don't reference req after put


From: Alex Elder <elder@inktank.com>

In __unregister_request(), there is a call to list_del_init()
referencing a request that was the subject of a call to
ceph_osdc_put_request() on the previous line.  This is not
safe, because the request structure could have been freed
by the time we reach the list_del_init().

Fix this by reversing the order of these lines.
