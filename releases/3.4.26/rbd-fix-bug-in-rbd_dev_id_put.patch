Subject: rbd: fix bug in rbd_dev_id_put()


From: Alex Elder <elder@inktank.com>

In rbd_dev_id_put(), there's a loop that's intended to determine
the maximum device id in use.  But it isn't doing that at all,
the effect of how it's written is to simply use the just-put id
number, which ignores whole purpose of this function.

Fix the bug.
