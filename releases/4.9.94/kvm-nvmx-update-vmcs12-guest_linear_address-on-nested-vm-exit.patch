Subject: KVM: nVMX: Update vmcs12->guest_linear_address on nested VM-exit

From: Jim Mattson <jmattson@google.com>


[ Upstream commit d281e13b0bfe745a21061a194e386a949784393f ]

The guest-linear address field is set for VM exits due to attempts to
execute LMSW with a memory operand and VM exits due to attempts to
execute INS or OUTS for which the relevant segment is usable,
regardless of whether or not EPT is in use.

Fixes: 119a9c01a5922 ("KVM: nVMX: pass valid guest linear-address to the L1")
