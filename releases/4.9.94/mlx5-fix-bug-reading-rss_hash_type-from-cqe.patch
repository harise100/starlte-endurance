Subject: mlx5: fix bug reading rss_hash_type from CQE

From: Jesper Dangaard Brouer <brouer@redhat.com>


[ Upstream commit 12e8b570e732eaa5eae3a2895ba3fbcf91bde2b4 ]

Masks for extracting part of the Completion Queue Entry (CQE)
field rss_hash_type was swapped, namely CQE_RSS_HTYPE_IP and
CQE_RSS_HTYPE_L4.

The bug resulted in setting skb->l4_hash, even-though the
rss_hash_type indicated that hash was NOT computed over the
L4 (UDP or TCP) part of the packet.

Added comments from the datasheet, to make it more clear what
these masks are selecting.
