Subject: rtc: interface: Validate alarm-time before handling rollover

From: Vaibhav Jain <vaibhav@linux.vnet.ibm.com>


[ Upstream commit da96aea0ed177105cb13ee83b328f6c61e061d3f ]

In function __rtc_read_alarm() its possible for an alarm time-stamp to
be invalid even after replacing missing components with current
time-stamp. The condition 'alarm->time.tm_year < 70' will trigger this
case and will cause the call to 'rtc_tm_to_time64(&alarm->time)'
return a negative value for variable t_alm.

While handling alarm rollover this negative t_alm (assumed to seconds
offset from '1970-01-01 00:00:00') is converted back to rtc_time via
rtc_time64_to_tm() which results in this error log with seemingly
garbage values:

"rtc rtc0: invalid alarm value: -2-1--1041528741
2005511117:71582844:32"

This error was generated when the rtc driver (rtc-opal in this case)
returned an alarm time-stamp of '00-00-00 00:00:00' to indicate that
the alarm is disabled. Though I have submitted a separate fix for the
rtc-opal driver, this issue may potentially impact other
existing/future rtc drivers.

To fix this issue the patch validates the alarm time-stamp just after
filling up the missing datetime components and if rtc_valid_tm() still
reports it to be invalid then bails out of the function without
handling the rollover.
