Subject: ARM: dts: armadillo800eva: Split LCD mux and gpio

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>


[ Upstream commit 13132b3f44d3600983aceb7e9920b8ebb55a7cf8 ]

Configuration of the lcd0 pinmux group and GPIO hog for the external
GPIO mux are done using a single device node, causing the "output-high"
property to be applied to both.  This will fail for the pinmux group,
but doesn't cause any harm, as the failure is ignored silently.

However, after "pinctrl: sh-pfc: propagate errors on group config", the
failure will become fatal, leading to a broken display:

    sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: pin_config_group_set op failed for group 102
    sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: Error applying setting, reverse things back
    sh-pfc e6050000.pin-controller: failed to select default state

Move the GPIO hog to its own node to fix this.
