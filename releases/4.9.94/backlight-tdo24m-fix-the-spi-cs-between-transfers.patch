Subject: backlight: tdo24m: Fix the SPI CS between transfers

From: Robert Jarzmik <robert.jarzmik@free.fr>


[ Upstream commit 2023b0524a6310e9ea80daf085f51c71bff9289f ]

Currently the LCD display (TD035S) on the cm-x300 platform is broken and
remains blank.

The TD0245S specification requires that the chipselect is toggled
between commands sent to the panel. This was also the purpose of the
former patch of commit f64dcac0b124 ("backlight: tdo24m: ensure chip
select changes between transfers").

Unfortunately, the "cs_change" field of a SPI transfer is
misleading. Its true meaning is that for a SPI message holding multiple
transfers, the chip select is toggled between each transfer, but for the
last transfer it remains asserted.

In this driver, all the SPI messages contain exactly one transfer, which
means that each transfer is the last of its message, and as a
consequence the chip select is never toggled.

Actually, there was a second bug hidding the first one, hence the
problem was not seen until v4.6. This problem was fixed by commit
a52db659c79c ("spi: pxa2xx: Fix cs_change management") for PXA based
boards.

This fix makes the TD035S work again on a cm-x300 board. The same
applies to other PXA boards, ie. corgi and tosa.
