Subject: mtd: nand: check ecc->total sanity in nand_scan_tail

From: Masahiro Yamada <yamada.masahiro@socionext.com>


[ Upstream commit 79e0348c4e24fd1affdcf055e0269755580e0fcc ]

Drivers are supposed to set correct ecc->{size,strength,bytes} before
calling nand_scan_tail(), but it does not complain about ecc->total
bigger than oobsize.

In this case, chip->scan_bbt() crashes due to memory corruption, but
it is hard to debug.  It would be kind to fail it earlier with a clear
message.
