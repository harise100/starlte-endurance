Subject: powerpc/64s: Fix pkey support in dt_cpu_ftrs, add CPU_FTR_PKEY bit

From: Nicholas Piggin <npiggin@gmail.com>

commit c130153e453cba0f37ad10fa18a1aa9c9a598a59 upstream.

The pkey code added a CPU_FTR_PKEY bit, but did not add it to the
dt_cpu_ftrs feature set. Although capability is supported by all
processors in the base dt_cpu_ftrs set for 64s, it's a significant
and sufficiently well defined feature to make it optional. So add
it as a quirk for now, which can be versioned out then controlled
by the firmware (once dt_cpu_ftrs gains versioning support).
