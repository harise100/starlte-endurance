Subject: powerpc/thp: Add write barrier after updating the valid bit

From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit b0aa44a3dfae3d8f45bd1264349aa87f87b7774f upstream.

With hugepages, we store the hpte valid information in the pte page
whose address is stored in the second half of the PMD. Use a
write barrier to make sure clearing pmd busy bit and updating
hpte valid info are ordered properly.
