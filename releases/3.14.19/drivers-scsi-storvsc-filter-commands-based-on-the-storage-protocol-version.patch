Subject: Drivers: scsi: storvsc: Filter commands based on the storage protocol version

From: "K. Y. Srinivasan" <kys@microsoft.com>

commit 8caf92d80526f3d7cc96831ec18b384ebcaccdf0 upstream.

Going forward it is possible that some of the commands that are not currently
implemented will be implemented on future Windows hosts. Even if they are not
implemented, we are told the host will corrrectly handle unsupported
commands (by returning appropriate return code and sense information).
Make command filtering depend on the host version.
