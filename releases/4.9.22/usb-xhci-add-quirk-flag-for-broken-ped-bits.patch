Subject: usb: xhci: add quirk flag for broken PED bits

[ Upstream commit 41135de1e7fd14c6fcb9158404ba5c8fb97bf259 ]

Some devices from Texas Instruments [1] suffer from
a silicon bug where Port Enabled/Disabled bit
should not be used to silence an erroneous device.

The bug is so that if port is disabled with PED
bit, an IRQ for device removal (or attachment)
will never fire.

Just for the sake of completeness, the actual
problem lies with SNPS USB IP and this affects
all known versions up to 3.00a. A separate
patch will be added to dwc3 to enabled this
quirk flag if version is <= 3.00a.
