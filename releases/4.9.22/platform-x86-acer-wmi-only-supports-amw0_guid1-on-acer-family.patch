Subject: platform/x86: acer-wmi: Only supports AMW0_GUID1 on acer family

[ Upstream commit 5241b1938a4d33eee3d3b43f23067c8e5b96db45 ]

The AMW0_GUID1 wmi is not only found on Acer family but also other
machines like Lenovo, Fujitsu and Medion. In the past, acer-wmi handled
those non-Acer machines by quirks list.

But actually acer-wmi driver was loaded on any machine that had
AMW0_GUID1. This behavior is strange because those machines should be
supported by appropriate wmi drivers. e.g. fujitsu-laptop,
ideapad-laptop.

This patch adds the logic to check the machine that has AMW0_GUID1
should be in Acer/Packard Bell/Gateway white list. But, it still keeps
the quirk list of those supported non-acer machines for backward
compatibility.
