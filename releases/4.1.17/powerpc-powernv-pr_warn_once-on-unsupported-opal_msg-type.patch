Subject: powerpc/powernv: pr_warn_once on unsupported OPAL_MSG type

From: Stewart Smith <stewart@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit 98da62b716a3b24ab8e77453c9a8a954124c18cd upstream.

When running on newer OPAL firmware that supports sending extra
OPAL_MSG types, we would print a warning on *every* message received.

This could be a problem for kernels that don't support OPAL_MSG_OCC
on machines that are running real close to thermal limits and the
OCC is throttling the chip. For a kernel that is paying attention to
the message queue, we could get these notifications quite often.

Conceivably, future message types could also come fairly often,
and printing that we didn't understand them 10,000 times provides
no further information than printing them once.
