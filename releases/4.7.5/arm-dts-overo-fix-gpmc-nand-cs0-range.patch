Subject: ARM: dts: overo: fix gpmc nand cs0 range

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit 5e0568dfbfb8c13cdb69c9fd06d600593ad4b430 upstream.

The gpmc ranges property for NAND at CS0 has been broken since it was
first added.

This currently prevents the nand gpmc child node from being probed:

	omap-gpmc 6e000000.gpmc: /ocp/gpmc@6e000000/nand@0,0 has
	malformed 'reg' property

and consequently the NAND device from being registered.

Fixes: 98ce6007efb4 ("ARM: dts: overo: Support PoP NAND")
