Subject: x86/apic/x2apic: Initialize cluster ID properly

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit fed71f7d98795ed0fa1d431910787f0f4a68324f upstream.

Rick bisected a regression on large systems which use the x2apic cluster
mode for interrupt delivery to the commit wich reworked the cluster
management.

The problem is caused by a missing initialization of the clusterid field
in the shared cluster data structures. So all structures end up with
cluster ID 0 which only allows sharing between all CPUs which belong to
cluster 0. All other CPUs with a cluster ID > 0 cannot share the data
structure because they cannot find existing data with their cluster
ID. This causes malfunction with IPIs because IPIs are sent to the wrong
cluster and the caller waits for ever that the target CPU handles the IPI.

Add the missing initialization when a upcoming CPU is the first in a
cluster so that the later booting CPUs can find the data and share it for
proper operation.
