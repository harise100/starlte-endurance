Subject: usb-storage: Workaround devices with bogus sense size

From: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>

commit b8430e1b82b7e514d76a88eb70a7d8831d50df1e upstream.

usb-storage: Workaround devices with bogus sense size

Some devices, such as Huawei E169, advertise more than the standard
amount of sense data, causing us to set US_FL_SANE_SENSE, assuming
they support it. However, they subsequently fail the request sense
with that size.

This works around it generically. When a sense request fails due to
a device returning an error, US_FL_SANE_SENSE was set, and that sense
request used a larger sense size, we retry with a smaller size before
giving up.

Based on an original patch by Ben Efros <ben@pc-doctor.com>
