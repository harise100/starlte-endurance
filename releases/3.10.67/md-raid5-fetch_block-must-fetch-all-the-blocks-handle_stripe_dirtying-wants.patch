Subject: md/raid5: fetch_block must fetch all the blocks handle_stripe_dirtying wants.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 108cef3aa41669610e1836fe638812dd067d72de upstream.

It is critical that fetch_block() and handle_stripe_dirtying()
are consistent in their analysis of what needs to be loaded.
Otherwise raid5 can wait forever for a block that won't be loaded.

Currently when writing to a RAID5 that is resyncing, to a location
beyond the resync offset, handle_stripe_dirtying chooses a
reconstruct-write cycle, but fetch_block() assumes a
read-modify-write, and a lockup can happen.

So treat that case just like RAID6, just as we do in
handle_stripe_dirtying.  RAID6 always does reconstruct-write.

This bug was introduced when the behaviour of handle_stripe_dirtying
was changed in 3.7, so the patch is suitable for any kernel since,
though it will need careful merging for some versions.
