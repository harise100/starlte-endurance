Subject: mmc: longer timeout for long read time quirk

From: Matt Gumbel <matthew.k.gumbel@intel.com>

commit 32ecd320db39bcb007679ed42f283740641b81ea upstream.

008GE0 Toshiba mmc in some Intel Baytrail tablets responds to
MMC_SEND_EXT_CSD in 450-600ms.

This patch will...

() Increase the long read time quirk timeout from 300ms to 600ms. Original
   author of that quirk says 300ms was only a guess and that the number
   may need to be raised in the future.

() Add this specific MMC to the quirk
