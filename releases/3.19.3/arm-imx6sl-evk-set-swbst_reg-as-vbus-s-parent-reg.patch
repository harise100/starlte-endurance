Subject: ARM: imx6sl-evk: set swbst_reg as vbus's parent reg

From: Peter Chen <peter.chen@freescale.com>

commit 2de9dd0391a74e80922c1bc95a78cedf85bcdc9e upstream.

USB vbus 5V is from PMIC SWBST, so set swbst_reg as vbus's
parent reg, it fixed a bug that the voltage of vbus is incorrect
due to swbst_reg is disabled after boots up.
