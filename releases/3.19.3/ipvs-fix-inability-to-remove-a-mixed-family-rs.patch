Subject: ipvs: fix inability to remove a mixed-family RS

From: Alexey Andriyanov <alan@al-an.info>

commit dd3733b3e798daf778a1ec08557f388f00fdc2f6 upstream.

The current code prevents any operation with a mixed-family dest
unless IP_VS_CONN_F_TUNNEL flag is set. The problem is that it's impossible
for the client to follow this rule, because ip_vs_genl_parse_dest does
not even read the destination conn_flags when cmd = IPVS_CMD_DEL_DEST
(need_full_dest = 0).

Also, not every client can pass this flag when removing a dest. ipvsadm,
for example, does not support the "-i" command line option together with
the "-d" option.

This change disables any checks for mixed-family on IPVS_CMD_DEL_DEST command.
