Subject: alpha: SMP boot fixes


From: Brian Uhrain <buhrain@rosettastone.com> says:

I've encountered two problems with 2.6.16 and newer kernels on my API CS20
(dual 833MHz Alpha 21264b processors).  The first is the kernel OOPSing
because of a NULL pointer dereference while trying to populate SysFS with the
CPU information.  The other is that only one processor was being brought up. 
I've included a small Alpha-specific patch that fixes both problems.

The first problem was caused by the CPUs never being properly registered using
register_cpu(), the way it's done on other architectures.

The second problem has to do with the removal of hwrpb_cpu_present_mask in
arch/alpha/kernel/smp.c.  In setup_smp() in the 2.6.15 kernel sources,
hwrpb_cpu_present_mask has a bit set for each processor that is probed, and
afterwards cpu_present_mask is set to the cpumask for the boot CPU.  In the
same function of the same file in the 2.6.16 sources, instead of
hwrpb_cpu_present_mask being set, cpu_possible_map is updated for each probed
CPU.  cpu_present_mask is still set to the cpumask of the boot CPU afterwards.
 The problem lies in include/asm-alpha/smp.h, where cpu_possible_map is
#define'd to be cpu_present_mask.

Cleanups from: Ivan Kokshaysky <ink@jurassic.park.msu.ru>

 - cpu_present_mask and cpu_possible_map are essentially the same thing
   on alpha, as it doesn't support CPU hotplug;
 - allocate "struct cpu" only for present CPUs, like sparc64 does.
   Static array of "struct cpu" is just a waste of memory.
