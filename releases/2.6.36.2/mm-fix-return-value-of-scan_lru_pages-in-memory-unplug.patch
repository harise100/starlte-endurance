Subject: mm: fix return value of scan_lru_pages in memory unplug

From: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

commit f8f72ad5396987e05a42cf7eff826fb2a15ff148 upstream.

scan_lru_pages returns pfn. So, it's type should be "unsigned long"
not "int".

Note: I guess this has been work until now because memory hotplug tester's
      machine has not very big memory....
      physical address < 32bit << PAGE_SHIFT.
