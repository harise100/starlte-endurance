Subject: libata: Modify quirks for MX100 to limit NCQ_TRIM quirk to MU01 version

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

commit d418ff56b8f2d2b296daafa8da151fe27689b757 upstream.

When commit 9c7be59fc519af ("libata: Apply NOLPM quirk to Crucial MX100
512GB SSDs") was added it inherited the ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk
from the existing "Crucial_CT*MX100*" entry, but that entry sets model_rev
to "MU01", where as the entry adding the NOLPM quirk sets it to NULL.

This means that after this commit we no apply the NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk to
all "Crucial_CT512MX100*" SSDs even if they have the fixed "MU02"
firmware. This commit splits the "Crucial_CT512MX100*" quirk into 2
quirks, one for the "MU01" firmware and one for all other firmware
versions, so that we once again only apply the NO_NCQ_TRIM quirk to the
"MU01" firmware version.
