Subject: net: sched: crash on blocks with goto chain action

From: Roman Kapl <code@rkapl.cz>

commit a60b3f515d30d0fe8537c64671926879a3548103 upstream.

tcf_block_put_ext has assumed that all filters (and thus their goto
actions) are destroyed in RCU callback and thus can not race with our
list iteration. However, that is not true during netns cleanup (see
tcf_exts_get_net comment).

Prevent the user after free by holding all chains (except 0, that one is
already held). foreach_safe is not enough in this case.

To reproduce, run the following in a netns and then delete the ns:
    ip link add dtest type dummy
    tc qdisc add dev dtest ingress
    tc filter add dev dtest chain 1 parent ffff: handle 1 prio 1 flower action goto chain 2
