Subject: arm64: dts: renesas: ulcb: Remove renesas, no-ether-link property

From: Bogdan Mirea <Bogdan-Stefan_Mirea@mentor.com>


[ Upstream commit 7d2901f809c110bd9a261e879d59efe62e3bc758 ]

The present change is a bug fix for AVB link iteratively up/down.

Steps to reproduce:
- start AVB TX stream (Using aplay via MSE),
- disconnect+reconnect the eth cable,
- after a reconnection the eth connection goes iteratively up/down
  without user interaction,
- this may heal after some seconds or even stay for minutes.

As the documentation specifies, the "renesas,no-ether-link" option
should be used when a board does not provide a proper AVB_LINK signal.
There is no need for this option enabled on RCAR H3/M3 Salvator-X/XS
and ULCB starter kits since the AVB_LINK is correctly handled by HW.

Choosing to keep or remove the "renesas,no-ether-link" option will
have impact on the code flow in the following ways:
- keeping this option enabled may lead to unexpected behavior since
  the RX & TX are enabled/disabled directly from adjust_link function
  without any HW interrogation,
- removing this option, the RX & TX will only be enabled/disabled after
  HW interrogation. The HW check is made through the LMON pin in PSR
  register which specifies AVB_LINK signal value (0 - at low level;
  1 - at high level).

In conclusion, the present change is also a safety improvement because
it removes the "renesas,no-ether-link" option leading to a proper way
of detecting the link state based on HW interrogation and not on
software heuristic.
