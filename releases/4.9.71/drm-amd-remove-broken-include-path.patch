Subject: drm: amd: remove broken include path

From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>


[ Upstream commit 655d9ca9ac075da1ef2a45012ba48a39f6eb1f58 ]

The AMD ACP driver adds "-I../acp -I../acp/include" to the gcc command
line, which makes no sense, since these are evaluated relative to the
build directory. When we build with "make W=1", they instead cause
a warning:

cc1: error: ../acp/: No such file or directory [-Werror=missing-include-dirs]
cc1: error: ../acp/include: No such file or directory [-Werror=missing-include-dirs]
cc1: all warnings being treated as errors
../scripts/Makefile.build:289: recipe for target 'drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_drv.o' failed
../scripts/Makefile.build:289: recipe for target 'drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_device.o' failed
../scripts/Makefile.build:289: recipe for target 'drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_kms.o' failed

This removes the subdir-ccflags variable that evidently did not
serve any purpose here.
