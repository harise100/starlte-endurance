Subject: usb: xhci: fix TDS for MTK xHCI1.1

From: Chunfeng Yun <chunfeng.yun@mediatek.com>

commit 72b663a99c074a8d073e7ecdae446cfb024ef551 upstream.

For MTK's xHCI 1.0 or latter, TD size is the number of max
packet sized packets remaining in the TD, not including
this TRB (following spec).

For MTK's xHCI 0.96 and older, TD size is the number of max
packet sized packets remaining in the TD, including this TRB
(not following spec).
