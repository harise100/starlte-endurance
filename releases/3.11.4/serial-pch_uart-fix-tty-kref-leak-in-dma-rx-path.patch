Subject: serial: pch_uart: fix tty-kref leak in dma-rx path

From: Johan Hovold <jhovold@gmail.com>

commit 19b85cfb190eb9980eaf416bff96aef4159a430e upstream.

Fix tty_kref leak when tty_buffer_request room fails in dma-rx path.

Note that the tty ref isn't really needed anymore, but as the leak has
always been there, fixing it before removing should makes it easier to
backport the fix.
