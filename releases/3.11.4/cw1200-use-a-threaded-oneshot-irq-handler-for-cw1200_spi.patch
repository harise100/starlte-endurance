Subject: cw1200: Use a threaded oneshot irq handler for cw1200_spi

From: Solomon Peachy <pizza@shaftnet.org>

commit 87421cb6010a2f6494938fbe0a95e1b096b3b7af upstream.

This supercedes the older patch ("cw1200: Don't perform SPI transfers in
interrupt context") that badly attempted to fix this problem.

This is a far simpler solution, which has the added benefit of
actually working.
