Subject: ntb: ntb_test: ensure the link is up before trying to configure the mws

From: Logan Gunthorpe <logang@deltatee.com>

commit 0eb46345364d7318b11068c46e8a68d5dc10f65e upstream.

After the link tests, there is a race on one side of the test for
the link coming up. It's possible, in some cases, for the test script
to write to the 'peer_trans' files before the link has come up.

To fix this, we simply use the link event file to ensure both sides
see the link as up before continuning.
