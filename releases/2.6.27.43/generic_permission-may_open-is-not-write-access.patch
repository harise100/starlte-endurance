Subject: generic_permission: MAY_OPEN is not write access

From: Serge E. Hallyn <serue@us.ibm.com>

commit 7ea6600148c265b1fd53e521022b1d7aec81d974 upstream.

generic_permission was refusing CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH-enabled
processes from opening DAC-protected files read-only, because
do_filp_open adds MAY_OPEN to the open mask.

Ignore MAY_OPEN.  After this patch, CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH is
again sufficient to open(fname, O_RDONLY) on a file to which
DAC otherwise refuses us read permission.
