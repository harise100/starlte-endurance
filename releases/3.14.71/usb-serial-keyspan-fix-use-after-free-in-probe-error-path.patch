Subject: USB: serial: keyspan: fix use-after-free in probe error path

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit 35be1a71d70775e7bd7e45fa6d2897342ff4c9d2 upstream.

The interface instat and indat URBs were submitted in attach, but never
unlinked in release before deallocating the corresponding transfer
buffers.

In the case of a late probe error (e.g. due to failed minor allocation),
disconnect would not have been called before release, causing the
buffers to be freed while the URBs are still in use. We'd also end up
with active URBs for an unbound interface.

Fixes: f9c99bb8b3a1 ("USB: usb-serial: replace shutdown with disconnect,
release")
