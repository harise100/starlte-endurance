Subject: ACPI video: Ignore errors after _DOD evaluation.

From: Igor Murzov <e-mail@date.by>

commit fba4e087361605d1eed63343bb08811f097c83ee upstream.

There are systems where video module known to work fine regardless
of broken _DOD and ignoring returned value here doesn't cause
any issues later. This should fix brightness controls on some laptops.
