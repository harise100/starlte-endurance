Subject: cifs: Do not lookup hashed negative dentry in cifs_atomic_open

From: Sachin Prabhu <sprabhu@redhat.com>

commit 3798f47aa276b332c30da499cb4df4577e2f8872 upstream.

We do not need to lookup a hashed negative directory since we have
already revalidated it before and have found it to be fine.

This also prevents a crash in cifs_lookup() when it attempts to rehash
the already hashed negative lookup dentry.

The patch has been tested using the reproducer at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=867344#c28
