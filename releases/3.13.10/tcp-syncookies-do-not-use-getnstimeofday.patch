Subject: tcp: syncookies: do not use getnstimeofday()

From: Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>

[ Upstream commit 632623153196bf183a69686ed9c07eee98ff1bf8 ]

While it is true that getnstimeofday() uses about 40 cycles if TSC
is available, it can use 1600 cycles if hpet is the clocksource.

Switch to get_jiffies_64(), as this is more than enough, and
go back to 60 seconds periods.

Fixes: 8c27bd75f04f ("tcp: syncookies: reduce cookie lifetime to 128 seconds")
