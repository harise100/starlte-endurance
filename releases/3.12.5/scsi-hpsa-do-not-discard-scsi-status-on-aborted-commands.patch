Subject: SCSI: hpsa: do not discard scsi status on aborted commands

From: "Stephen M. Cameron" <scameron@beardog.cce.hp.com>

commit 2e311fbabdc23b7eaec77313dc3b9a151a5407b5 upstream.

We inadvertantly discarded the scsi status for aborted commands.
For some commands (e.g. reads from tape drives) these can't be retried,
and if we discarded the scsi status, the scsi mid layer couldn't notice
anything was wrong and the error was not reported.
