Subject: coredump: suppress uid comparison test if core output files are pipes

From: Neil Horman <nhorman@tuxdriver.com>

commit 76595f79d76fbe6267a51b3a866a028d150f06d4 upstream.

Modify uid check in do_coredump so as to not apply it in the case of
pipes.

This just got noticed in testing.  The end of do_coredump validates the
uid of the inode for the created file against the uid of the crashing
process to ensure that no one can pre-create a core file with different
ownership and grab the information contained in the core when they
shouldn' tbe able to.  This causes failures when using pipes for a core
dumps if the crashing process is not root, which is the uid of the pipe
when it is created.

The fix is simple.  Since the check for matching uid's isn't relevant for
pipes (a process can't create a pipe that the uermodehelper code will open
anyway), we can just just skip it in the event ispipe is non-zero

Reverts a pipe-affecting change which was accidentally made in
