Subject: clk: rockchip: rk3368: fix cpuclk mux bit of big cpu-cluster

From: Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de>

commit 535ebd428aeb07c3327947281306f2943f2c9faa upstream.

Both clusters have their mux bit in bit 7 of their respective register.
For whatever reason the big cluster currently lists bit 15 which is
definitly wrong.
