Subject: mm/memory.c: use entry = ACCESS_ONCE(*pte) in handle_pte_fault()

From: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

commit c0d73261f5c1355a35b8b40e871d31578ce0c044 upstream.

Use ACCESS_ONCE() in handle_pte_fault() when getting the entry or
orig_pte upon which all subsequent decisions and pte_same() tests will
be made.

I have no evidence that its lack is responsible for the mm/filemap.c:202
BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)) in __delete_from_page_cache() found by
trinity, and I am not optimistic that it will fix it.  But I have found
no other explanation, and ACCESS_ONCE() here will surely not hurt.

If gcc does re-access the pte before passing it down, then that would be
disastrous for correct page fault handling, and certainly could explain
the page_mapped() BUGs seen (concurrent fault causing page to be mapped
in a second time on top of itself: mapcount 2 for a single pte).
