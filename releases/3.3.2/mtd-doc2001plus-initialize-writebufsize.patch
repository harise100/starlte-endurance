Subject: mtd: doc2001plus: initialize writebufsize

From: Artem Bityutskiy <artem.bityutskiy@linux.intel.com>

commit 71f60fbebf0f18dd4e855335a009efda251b1697 upstream.

The writebufsize concept was introduce by commit
"0e4ca7e mtd: add writebufsize field to mtd_info struct" and it represents
the maximum amount of data the device writes to the media at a time. This is
an important parameter for UBIFS which is used during recovery and which
basically defines how big a corruption caused by a power cut can be.

Set it to be equivalent to mtd->writesize because this is the maximum amount
of data the driver writes at a time.
