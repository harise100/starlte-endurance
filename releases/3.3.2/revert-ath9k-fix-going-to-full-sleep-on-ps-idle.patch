Subject: Revert "ath9k: fix going to full-sleep on PS idle"

From: Sujith Manoharan <c_manoha@qca.qualcomm.com>

commit 011afa1ed8c408d694957d2474d89dc81a60b70c upstream.

This reverts commit c1afdaff90538ef085b756454f12b29575411214.

Users have reported connection failures in 3.3.1 and suspend/resume
failures in 3.4-rcX. Revert this commit for now - PS IDLE can be
fixed in a clean manner later on.
