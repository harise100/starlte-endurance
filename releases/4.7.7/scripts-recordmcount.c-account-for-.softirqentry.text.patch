Subject: scripts/recordmcount.c: account for .softirqentry.text

From: Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>

commit e436fd61a8f62cb7a16310a42b95ab076ff72eff upstream.

be7635e7287e ("arch, ftrace: for KASAN put hard/soft IRQ entries into
separate sections") added .softirqentry.text section, but it was not added
to recordmcount.  So functions in the section are untracable.  Add the
section to scripts/recordmcount.c and scripts/recordmcount.pl.

Fixes: be7635e7287e ("arch, ftrace: for KASAN put hard/soft IRQ entries into separate sections")
