Subject: Bluetooth: split sk_filter in l2cap_sock_recv_cb

From: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>

commit dbb50887c8f619fc5c3489783ebc3122bc134a31 upstream.

During an audit for sk_filter(), we found that rx_busy_skb handling
in l2cap_sock_recv_cb() and l2cap_sock_recvmsg() looks not quite as
intended.

The assumption from commit e328140fdacb ("Bluetooth: Use event-driven
approach for handling ERTM receive buffer") is that errors returned
from sock_queue_rcv_skb() are due to receive buffer shortage. However,
nothing should prevent doing a setsockopt() with SO_ATTACH_FILTER on
the socket, that could drop some of the incoming skbs when handled in
sock_queue_rcv_skb().

In that case sock_queue_rcv_skb() will return with -EPERM, propagated
from sk_filter() and if in L2CAP_MODE_ERTM mode, wrong assumption was
that we failed due to receive buffer being full. From that point onwards,
due to the to-be-dropped skb being held in rx_busy_skb, we cannot make
any forward progress as rx_busy_skb is never cleared from l2cap_sock_recvmsg(),
due to the filter drop verdict over and over coming from sk_filter().
Meanwhile, in l2cap_sock_recv_cb() all new incoming skbs are being
dropped due to rx_busy_skb being occupied.

Instead, just use __sock_queue_rcv_skb() where an error really tells that
there's a receive buffer issue. Split the sk_filter() and enable it for
non-segmented modes at queuing time since at this point in time the skb has
already been through the ERTM state machine and it has been acked, so dropping
is not allowed. Instead, for ERTM and streaming mode, call sk_filter() in
l2cap_data_rcv() so the packet can be dropped before the state machine sees it.
