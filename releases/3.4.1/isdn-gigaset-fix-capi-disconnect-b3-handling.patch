Subject: isdn/gigaset: fix CAPI disconnect B3 handling

From: Tilman Schmidt <tilman@imap.cc>

commit 62a1cfe052346b96a552b6a9178d412c709711bb upstream.

If DISCONNECT_B3_IND was synthesized because of a DISCONNECT_REQ
with existing logical connections, the connection state wasn't
updated accordingly. Also the emitted DISCONNECT_B3_IND message
wasn't included in the debug log as requested.
This patch fixes both of these issues.
