Subject: mm: vmscan: do not use page_count without a page pin

commit: d179e84ba5da1d0024087d1759a2938817a00f3f upstream

It is unsafe to run page_count during the physical pfn scan because
compound_head could trip on a dangling pointer when reading
page->first_page if the compound page is being freed by another CPU.
