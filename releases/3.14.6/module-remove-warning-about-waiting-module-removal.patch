Subject: module: remove warning about waiting module removal.

From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>

commit 79465d2fd48e68940c2bdecddbdecd45bbba06fe upstream.

We remove the waiting module removal in commit 3f2b9c9cdf38 (September
2013), but it turns out that modprobe in kmod (< version 16) was
asking for waiting module removal.  No one noticed since modprobe would
check for 0 usage immediately before trying to remove the module, and
the race is unlikely.

However, it means that anyone running old (but not ancient) kmod
versions is hitting the printk designed to see if anyone was running
"rmmod -w".  All reports so far have been false positives, so remove
the warning.
