Subject: rtmutex: Fix deadlock detector for real

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

commit 397335f004f41e5fcf7a795e94eb3ab83411a17c upstream.

The current deadlock detection logic does not work reliably due to the
following early exit path:

	/*
	 * Drop out, when the task has no waiters. Note,
	 * top_waiter can be NULL, when we are in the deboosting
	 * mode!
	 */
	if (top_waiter && (!task_has_pi_waiters(task) ||
			   top_waiter != task_top_pi_waiter(task)))
		goto out_unlock_pi;

So this not only exits when the task has no waiters, it also exits
unconditionally when the current waiter is not the top priority waiter
of the task.

So in a nested locking scenario, it might abort the lock chain walk
and therefor miss a potential deadlock.

Simple fix: Continue the chain walk, when deadlock detection is
enabled.

We also avoid the whole enqueue, if we detect the deadlock right away
(A-A). It's an optimization, but also prevents that another waiter who
comes in after the detection and before the task has undone the damage
observes the situation and detects the deadlock and returns
-EDEADLOCK, which is wrong as the other task is not in a deadlock
situation.
