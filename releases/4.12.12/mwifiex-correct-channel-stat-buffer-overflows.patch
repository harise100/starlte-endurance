Subject: mwifiex: correct channel stat buffer overflows

From: Brian Norris <briannorris@chromium.org>

commit 4b5dde2d6234ff5bc68e97e6901d1f2a0a7f3749 upstream.

mwifiex records information about various channels as it receives scan
information. It does this by appending to a buffer that was sized
to the max number of supported channels on any band, but there are
numerous problems:

(a) scans can return info from more than one band (e.g., both 2.4 and 5
    GHz), so the determined "max" is not large enough
(b) some firmware appears to return multiple results for a given
    channel, so the max *really* isn't large enough
(c) there is no bounds checking when stashing these stats, so problems
    (a) and (b) can easily lead to buffer overflows

Let's patch this by setting a slightly-more-correct max (that accounts
for a combination of both 2.4G and 5G bands) and adding a bounds check
when writing to our statistics buffer.

Due to problem (b), we still might not properly report all known survey
information (e.g., with "iw <dev> survey dump"), since duplicate results
(or otherwise "larger than expected" results) will cause some
truncation. But that's a problem for a future bugfix.

(And because of this known deficiency, only log the excess at the WARN
level, since that isn't visible by default in this driver and would
otherwise be a bit too noisy.)
