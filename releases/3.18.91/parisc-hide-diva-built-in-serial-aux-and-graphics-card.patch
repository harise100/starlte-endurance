Subject: parisc: Hide Diva-built-in serial aux and graphics card

From: Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>

commit bcf3f1752a622f1372d3252d0fea8855d89812e7 upstream.

Diva GSP card has built-in serial AUX port and ATI graphic card which simply
don't work and which both don't have external connectors.  User Guides even
mention that those devices shouldn't be used.
So, prevent that Linux drivers try to enable those devices.

+ * Radeon 7000 graphics card which both don't have any external connectors and
+ * thus are useless, and even worse, e.g. the AUX port occupies ttyS0 and as
+ * such makes those machines the only PARISC machines on which we can't use
+ * ttyS0 as boot console.
