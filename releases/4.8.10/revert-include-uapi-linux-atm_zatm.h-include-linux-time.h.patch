Subject: Revert "include/uapi/linux/atm_zatm.h: include linux/time.h"

From: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>


[ Upstream commit 7b5b74efcca00f15c2aec1dc7175bfe34b6ec643 ]

This reverts commit cf00713a655d ("include/uapi/linux/atm_zatm.h: include
linux/time.h").

This attempted to fix userspace breakage that no longer existed when
the patch was merged.  Almost one year earlier, commit 70ba07b675b5
("atm: remove 'struct zatm_t_hist'") deleted the struct in question.

After this patch was merged, we now have to deal with people being
unable to include this header in conjunction with standard C library
headers like stdlib.h (which linux-atm does).  Example breakage:
x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../.. -I./../q2931 -I./../saal \
	-I.  -DCPPFLAGS_TEST  -I../../src/include -O2 -march=native -pipe -g \
	-frecord-gcc-switches -freport-bug -Wimplicit-function-declaration \
	-Wnonnull -Wstrict-aliasing -Wparentheses -Warray-bounds \
	-Wfree-nonheap-object -Wreturn-local-addr -fno-strict-aliasing -Wall \
	-Wshadow -Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings -Wstrict-prototypes -c zntune.c
