Subject: rbd: protect against concurrent unmaps

From: Alex Elder <elder@inktank.com>

commit 82a442d239695a242c4d584464c9606322cd02aa upstream.

Make sure two concurrent unmap operations on the same rbd device
won't collide, by only proceeding with the removal and cleanup of a
device if is not already underway.
