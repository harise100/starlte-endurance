Subject: ALSA: hda - Fix headphone noise on Dell XPS 13 9360

From: Kai-Heng Feng <kaihengfeng@gmail.com>

commit 423cd785619ac6778252fbdb916505aa1c153959 upstream.

The headphone has noise when playing sound or switching microphone sources.
It uses the same codec on XPS 13 9350, but with different subsystem ID.
Applying the fixup can solve the issue.
Also, changing the model name to better differentiate models.

v2: Reorder by device ID.
