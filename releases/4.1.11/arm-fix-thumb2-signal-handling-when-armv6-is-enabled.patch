Subject: ARM: fix Thumb2 signal handling when ARMv6 is enabled

From: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>

commit 9b55613f42e8d40d5c9ccb8970bde6af4764b2ab upstream.

When a kernel is built covering ARMv6 to ARMv7, we omit to clear the
IT state when entering a signal handler.  This can cause the first
few instructions to be conditionally executed depending on the parent
context.

In any case, the original test for >= ARMv7 is broken - ARMv6 can have
Thumb-2 support as well, and an ARMv6T2 specific build would omit this
code too.

Relax the test back to ARMv6 or greater.  This results in us always
clearing the IT state bits in the PSR, even on CPUs where these bits
are reserved.  However, they're reserved for the IT state, so this
should cause no harm.
