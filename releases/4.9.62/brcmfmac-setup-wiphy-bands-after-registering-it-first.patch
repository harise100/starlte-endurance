Subject: brcmfmac: setup wiphy bands after registering it first

From: Rafał Miłecki <rafal@milecki.pl>


[ Upstream commit ab99063f873749b3c3b1e5d44038559883465e74 ]

During bands setup we disable all channels that firmware doesn't support
in the current regulatory setup. If we do this before wiphy_register
it will result in copying set flags (including IEEE80211_CHAN_DISABLED)
to the orig_flags which is supposed to be persistent. We don't want this
as regulatory change may result in enabling some channels. We shouldn't
mess with orig_flags then (by changing them or ignoring them) so it's
better to just take care of their proper values.

This patch cleanups code a bit (by taking orig_flags more seriously) and
allows further improvements like disabling really unavailable channels.
We will need that e.g. if some frequencies should be disabled for good
due to hardware setup (design).
