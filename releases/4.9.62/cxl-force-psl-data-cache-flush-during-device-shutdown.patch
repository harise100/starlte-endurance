Subject: cxl: Force psl data-cache flush during device shutdown

From: Vaibhav Jain <vaibhav@linux.vnet.ibm.com>


[ Upstream commit d7b1946c7925a270062b2e0718aa57b42ba619c0 ]

This change adds a force psl data cache flush during device shutdown
callback. This should reduce a possibility of psl holding a dirty
cache line while the CAPP is being reinitialized, which may result in
a UE [load/store] machine check error.
