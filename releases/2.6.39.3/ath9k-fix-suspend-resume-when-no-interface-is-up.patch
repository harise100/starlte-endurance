Subject: ath9k: Fix suspend/resume when no interface is UP

From: Rajkumar Manoharan <rmanohar@qca.qualcomm.com>

commit c31eb8e926835582cd186b33a7a864880a4c0c79 upstream.

When no interface has been brought up, the chip's power
state continued as AWAKE. So during resume, the chip never
been powered up.
