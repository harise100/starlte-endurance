Subject: drm/i915: Fix gen6 (SNB) missed BLT ring interrupts.

From: Daniel J Blueman <daniel.blueman@gmail.com>

commit 498e720b96379d8ee9c294950a01534a73defcf3 upstream.

The failure appeared in dmesg as:

[drm:i915_hangcheck_ring_idle] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... blt
ring idle [waiting on 35064155, at 35064155], missed IRQ?

This works around that problem on by making the blitter command
streamer write interrupt state to the Hardware Status Page when a
MI_USER_INTERRUPT command is decoded, which appears to force the seqno
out to memory before the interrupt happens.

v1->v2: Moved to prior interrupt handler installation and RMW flags as
per feedback.
v2->v3: Removed RMW of flags (by anholt)
