Subject: ath5k: fix memory leak when fewer than N_PD_CURVES are in use

From: "Eugene A. Shatokhin" <dame_eugene@mail.ru>

commit a0b8de350be458b33248e48b2174d9af8a4c4798 upstream.

We would free the proper number of curves, but in the wrong
slots, due to a missing level of indirection through
the pdgain_idx table.

It's simpler just to try to free all four slots, so do that.
