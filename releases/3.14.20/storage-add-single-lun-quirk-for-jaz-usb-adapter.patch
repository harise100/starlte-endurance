Subject: storage: Add single-LUN quirk for Jaz USB Adapter

From: Mark <markk@clara.co.uk>

commit c66f1c62e85927357e7b3f4c701614dcb5c498a2 upstream.

The Iomega Jaz USB Adapter is a SCSI-USB converter cable. The hardware
seems to be identical to e.g. the Microtech XpressSCSI, using a Shuttle/
SCM chip set. However its firmware restricts it to only work with Jaz
drives.

On connecting the cable a message like this appears four times in the log:
 reset full speed USB device number 4 using uhci_hcd

That's non-fatal but the US_FL_SINGLE_LUN quirk fixes it.
