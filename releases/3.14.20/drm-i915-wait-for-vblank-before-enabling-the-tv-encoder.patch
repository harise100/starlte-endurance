commit 7a98948f3b536ca9a077e84966ddc0e9f53726df upstream.

The vblank waits in intel_tv_detect_type() are timing out for some
reason. This is a regression caused removing seemingly useless vblank
waits from the modeset seqeuence in:

    drm/i915: Kill vblank waits after pipe enable on gmch platforms

So it turns out they weren't all entirely useless. Apparently the pipe
has to go through one full frame before we enable the TV port. Add a
vblank wait to intel_enable_tv() to make sure that happens.

Another approach was attempted by placing the vblank wait just after
enabling the port. The theory behind that attempt was that we need to
let the port stay enabled for one full frame before disabling it again
during load detection. But that didn't work, and we definitely must
have the vblank wait before enabling the port.
