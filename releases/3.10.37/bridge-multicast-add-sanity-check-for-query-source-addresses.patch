[ Upstream commit 6565b9eeef194afbb3beec80d6dd2447f4091f8c ]

MLD queries are supposed to have an IPv6 link-local source address
according to RFC2710, section 4 and RFC3810, section 5.1.14. This patch
adds a sanity check to ignore such broken MLD queries.

Without this check, such malformed MLD queries can result in a
denial of service: The queries are ignored by any MLD listener
therefore they will not respond with an MLD report. However,
without this patch these malformed MLD queries would enable the
snooping part in the bridge code, potentially shutting down the
according ports towards these hosts for multicast traffic as the
bridge did not learn about these listeners.
