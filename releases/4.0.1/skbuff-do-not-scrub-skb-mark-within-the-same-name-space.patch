Sure.

PS I used the wrong email for James the first time around.  So
let me repeat the question here.  Should secmark be preserved
or cleared across tunnels within the same name space? In fact,
do our security models even support name spaces?

The commit ea23192e8e577dfc51e0f4fc5ca113af334edff9 ("tunnels:
harmonize cleanup done on skb on rx path") broke anyone trying to
use netfilter marking across IPv4 tunnels.  While most of the
fields that are cleared by skb_scrub_packet don't matter, the
netfilter mark must be preserved.

This patch rearranges skb_scrub_packet to preserve the mark field.
