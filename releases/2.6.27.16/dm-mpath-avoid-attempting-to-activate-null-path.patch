Subject: dm mpath: avoid attempting to activate null path

From: Chandra Seetharaman <sekharan@us.ibm.com>

commit b81aa1c79201cb424114fd198607951900babe18 upstream.

Path activation code is called even when the pgpath is NULL. This could
lead to a panic in activate_path(). Such a panic is seen in -rt kernel.

This problem has been there before the pg_init() was moved to a
workqueue.
