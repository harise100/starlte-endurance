Subject: mmc: sdio: remember new card RCA when redetecting card

From: Stefan Nilsson XK <stefan.xk.nilsson@stericsson.com>

commit 0aab3995485b8a994bf29a995a008c9ea4a28054 upstream.

During redetection of a SDIO card, a request for a new card RCA
was submitted to the card, but was then overwritten by the old RCA.
This caused the card to be deselected instead of selected when using
the incorrect RCA.  This bug's been present since the "oldcard"
handling was introduced in 2.6.32.
