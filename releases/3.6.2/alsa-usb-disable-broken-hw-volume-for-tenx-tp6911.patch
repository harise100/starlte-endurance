Subject: ALSA: usb - disable broken hw volume for Tenx TP6911

From: David Henningsson <david.henningsson@canonical.com>

commit c10514394ef9e8de93a4ad8c8904d71dcd82c122 upstream.

While going through Ubuntu bugs, I discovered this patch being
posted and a confirmation that the patch works as expected.

Finding out how the hw volume really works would be preferrable
to just disabling the broken one, but this would be better than
nothing.
