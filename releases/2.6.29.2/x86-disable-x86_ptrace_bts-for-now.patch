Subject: x86: disable X86_PTRACE_BTS for now

upstream commit: d45b41ae8da0f54aec0eebcc6f893ba5f22a1e8e

Oleg Nesterov found a couple of races in the ptrace-bts code
and fixes are queued up for it but they did not get ready in time
for the merge window. We'll merge them in v2.6.31 - until then
mark the feature as CONFIG_BROKEN. There's no user-space yet
making use of this so it's not a big issue.
