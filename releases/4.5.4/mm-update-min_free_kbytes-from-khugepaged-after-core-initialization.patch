Subject: mm: update min_free_kbytes from khugepaged after core initialization

From: Jason Baron <jbaron@akamai.com>

commit bc22af74f271ef76b2e6f72f3941f91f0da3f5f8 upstream.

Khugepaged attempts to raise min_free_kbytes if its set too low.
However, on boot khugepaged sets min_free_kbytes first from
subsys_initcall(), and then the mm 'core' over-rides min_free_kbytes
after from init_per_zone_wmark_min(), via a module_init() call.

Khugepaged used to use a late_initcall() to set min_free_kbytes (such
that it occurred after the core initialization), however this was
removed when the initialization of min_free_kbytes was integrated into
the starting of the khugepaged thread.

The fix here is simply to invoke the core initialization using a
core_initcall() instead of module_init(), such that the previous
initialization ordering is restored.  I didn't restore the
late_initcall() since start_stop_khugepaged() already sets
min_free_kbytes via set_recommended_min_free_kbytes().

This was noticed when we had a number of page allocation failures when
moving a workload to a kernel with this new initialization ordering.  On
an 8GB system this restores min_free_kbytes back to 67584 from 11365
when CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y is set and either
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_ALWAYS=y or
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_MADVISE=y.
