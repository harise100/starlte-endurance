Subject: MD: make bio mergeable

From: Shaohua Li <shli@fb.com>

commit 9c573de3283af007ea11c17bde1e4568d9417328 upstream.

blk_queue_split marks bio unmergeable, which makes sense for normal bio.
But if dispatching the bio to underlayer disk, the blk_queue_split
checks are invalid, hence it's possible the bio becomes mergeable.

In the reported bug, this bug causes trim against raid0 performance slash
