Subject: x86, mtrr: lock stop machine during MTRR rendezvous sequence

From: Suresh Siddha <suresh.b.siddha@intel.com>

commit 6d3321e8e2b3bf6a5892e2ef673c7bf536e3f904 upstream.

MTRR rendezvous sequence using stop_one_cpu_nowait() can potentially
happen in parallel with another system wide rendezvous using
stop_machine(). This can lead to deadlock (The order in which
works are queued can be different on different cpu's. Some cpu's
will be running the first rendezvous handler and others will be running
the second rendezvous handler. Each set waiting for the other set to join
for the system wide rendezvous, leading to a deadlock).

MTRR rendezvous sequence is not implemented using stop_machine() as this
gets called both from the process context aswell as the cpu online paths
(where the cpu has not come online and the interrupts are disabled etc).
stop_machine() works with only online cpus.

For now, take the stop_machine mutex in the MTRR rendezvous sequence that
gets called from an online cpu (here we are in the process context
and can potentially sleep while taking the mutex). And the MTRR rendezvous
that gets triggered during cpu online doesn't need to take this stop_machine
lock (as the stop_machine() already ensures that there is no cpu hotplug
going on in parallel by doing get_online_cpus())

    TBD: Pursue a cleaner solution of extending the stop_machine()
         infrastructure to handle the case where the calling cpu is
         still not online and use this for MTRR rendezvous sequence.
