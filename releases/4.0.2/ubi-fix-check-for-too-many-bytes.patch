Subject: UBI: fix check for "too many bytes"

From: Brian Norris <computersforpeace@gmail.com>

commit 299d0c5b27346a77a0777c993372bf8777d4f2e5 upstream.

The comparison from the previous line seems to have been erroneously
(partially) copied-and-pasted onto the next. The second line should be
checking req.bytes, not req.lnum.

Coverity CID #139400
