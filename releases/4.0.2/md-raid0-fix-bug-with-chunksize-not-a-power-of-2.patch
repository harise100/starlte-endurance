Subject: md/raid0: fix bug with chunksize not a power of 2.

From: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>

commit 47d68979cc968535cb87f3e5f2e6a3533ea48fbd upstream.

Since commit 20d0189b1012a37d2533a87fb451f7852f2418d1
in v3.14-rc1 RAID0 has performed incorrect calculations
when the chunksize is not a power of 2.

This happens because "sector_div()" modifies its first argument, but
this wasn't taken into account in the patch.

So restore that first arg before re-using the variable.
