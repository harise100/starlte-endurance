Subject: IB/core: don't disallow registering region starting at 0x0

From: Yann Droneaud <ydroneaud@opteya.com>

commit 66578b0b2f69659f00b6169e6fe7377c4b100d18 upstream.

In a call to ib_umem_get(), if address is 0x0 and size is
already page aligned, check added in commit 8494057ab5e4
("IB/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow in ib_umem_get address
arithmetic") will refuse to register a memory region that
could otherwise be valid (provided vm.mmap_min_addr sysctl
and mmap_low_allowed SELinux knobs allow userspace to map
something at address 0x0).

This patch allows back such registration: ib_umem_get()
should probably don't care of the base address provided it
can be pinned with get_user_pages().

There's two possible overflows, in (addr + size) and in
PAGE_ALIGN(addr + size), this patch keep ensuring none
of them happen while allowing to pin memory at address
0x0. Anyway, the case of size equal 0 is no more (partially)
handled as 0-length memory region are disallowed by an
earlier check.
