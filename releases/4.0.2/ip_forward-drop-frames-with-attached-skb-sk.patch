Subject: ip_forward: Drop frames with attached skb->sk

From: =?UTF-8?q?Sebastian=20P=C3=B6hn?= <sebastian.poehn@gmail.com>

[ Upstream commit 2ab957492d13bb819400ac29ae55911d50a82a13 ]

Initial discussion was:
[FYI] xfrm: Don't lookup sk_policy for timewait sockets

Forwarded frames should not have a socket attached. Especially
tw sockets will lead to panics later-on in the stack.

This was observed with TPROXY assigning a tw socket and broken
policy routing (misconfigured). As a result frame enters
forwarding path instead of input. We cannot solve this in
TPROXY as it cannot know that policy routing is broken.

v2:
Remove useless comment
