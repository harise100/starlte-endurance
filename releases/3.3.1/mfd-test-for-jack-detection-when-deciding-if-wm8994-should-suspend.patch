Subject: mfd: Test for jack detection when deciding if wm8994 should suspend

From: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>

commit d2cb87c23e8514ca49c85adc5924999927bb9494 upstream.

The jack detection on WM1811 is often required during system suspend, add
it as another check when deciding if we should suspend.
