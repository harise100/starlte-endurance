Subject: [media] au8522: bug-fix: enable modulation AFTER tune (instead of before tuning)

From: Michael Krufky <mkrufky@kernellabs.com>

commit ef3d2dc366c8c32d58dbbf9898cfd4f853ff8fe0 upstream.

The au8522 driver programs the tuner after programming the demodulator,
but the tuner should be programmed first. This patch fixes this behavior.

EDIT: Apparantly Devin created a similar patch some time ago, but hasn't
submitted it for merge.  I never saw his patch, but I thank him anyhow
for his efforts.  In addition, Devin pointed out a flaw in my patch:

This newly generated patch takes Devin's comments into account.

Thanks-to: Devin Heitmueller <dheitmueller@kernellabs.com>
