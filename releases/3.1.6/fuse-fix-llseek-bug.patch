Subject: fuse: fix llseek bug

From: Roel Kluin <roel.kluin@gmail.com>

commit b48c6af2086ab2ba8a9c9b6ce9ecb34592ce500c upstream.

The test in fuse_file_llseek() "not SEEK_CUR or not SEEK_SET" always evaluates
to true.

This was introduced in 3.1 by commit 06222e49 (fs: handle SEEK_HOLE/SEEK_DATA
properly in all fs's that define their own llseek) and changed the behavior of
SEEK_CUR and SEEK_SET to always retrieve the file attributes.  This is a
performance regression.

Fix the test so that it makes sense.
