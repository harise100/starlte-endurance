Subject: IB/uverbs: Fix checking of userspace object ownership
To: stable@kernel.org
Message-ID: <ada7il7xitj.fsf@cisco.com>

From: Roland Dreier <rolandd@cisco.com>

Upstream as cbfb50e6e2e9c580848c0f51d37c24cdfb1cb704

Commit 9ead190b ("IB/uverbs: Don't serialize with ib_uverbs_idr_mutex")
rewrote how userspace objects are looked up in the uverbs module's
idrs, and introduced a severe bug in the process: there is no checking
that an operation is being performed by the right process any more.
Fix this by adding the missing check of uobj->context in __idr_get_uobj().

Apparently everyone is being very careful to only touch their own
objects, because this bug was introduced in June 2006 in 2.6.18, and
has gone undetected until now.
