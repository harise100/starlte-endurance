Subject: ARM: mvebu: armada-xp-openblocks-ax3-4: Disable internal RTC

From: Gregory CLEMENT <gregory.clement@free-electrons.com>

commit 750e30d4076ae5e02ad13a376e96c95a2627742c upstream.

There is no crystal connected to the internal RTC on the Open Block
AX3. So let's disable it in order to prevent the kernel probing the
driver uselessly. Eventually this patches removes the following
warning message from the boot log:
"rtc-mv d0010300.rtc: internal RTC not ticking"
