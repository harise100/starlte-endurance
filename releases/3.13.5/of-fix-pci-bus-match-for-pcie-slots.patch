Subject: of: fix PCI bus match for PCIe slots

From: Kleber Sacilotto de Souza <klebers@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit 14e2abb732e485ee57d9d5b2cb8884652238e5c1 upstream.

On IBM pseries systems the device_type device-tree property of a PCIe
bridge contains the string "pciex". The of_bus_pci_match() function was
looking only for "pci" on this property, so in such cases the bus
matching code was falling back to the default bus, causing problems on
functions that should be using "assigned-addresses" for region address
translation. This patch fixes the problem by also looking for "pciex" on
the PCI bus match function.
