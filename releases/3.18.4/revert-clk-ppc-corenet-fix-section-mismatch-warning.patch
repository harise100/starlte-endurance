Subject: Revert "clk: ppc-corenet: Fix Section mismatch warning"

From: Kevin Hao <haokexin@gmail.com>

commit 176a107b868781c8d6868454aea7d07e0b82d6b8 upstream.

This reverts commit da788acb28386aa896224e784954bb73c99ff26c.

That commit tried to fix the section mismatch warning by moving the
ppc_corenet_clk_driver struct to init section. This is definitely wrong
because the kernel would free the memories occupied by this struct
after boot while this driver is still registered in the driver core.
The kernel would panic when accessing this driver struct.
