Subject: bus: omap_l3_noc: Add resume hook to restore context

From: Keerthy <j-keerthy@ti.com>

commit 61b43d4e919e8fa5e10c77ee32ba328da07e0264 upstream.

On certain SoCs such as AM437x SoC, L3_noc error registers are
maintained in power domain such as per domain which looses context as part
of low power state such as RTC+DDR mode. On these platforms when we
mask interrupts which we cannot handle, the source of these interrupts
still remain on resume, however, the flag mux registers now contain
their reset value (unmasked) - this breaks the system with infinite
interrupts since we do not these interrupts to take place ever again.

To handle this: restore the masking of interrupts which we have
already recorded in the system as ones we cannot handle.
