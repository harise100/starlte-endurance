Subject: serial: fix parisc boot hang

From: James Bottomley <JBottomley@Parallels.com>

commit 68ed7e1c3d236e9e1e60ed6cae22f2c1c4ba2952 upstream.

This is a partial revert of 2f2dafe (serial: serial_core.c: printk
replacement) which gets us booting again.  The real problem seems to be
the _emit path in early boot.  However, until we can root cause it, we
need at least to get boot working.

Fixes: 2f2dafe77df2c78e189a9fa6b1879dffd06ae5a1
