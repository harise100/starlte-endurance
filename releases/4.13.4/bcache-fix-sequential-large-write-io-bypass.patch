commit c81ffa32a214c84b08900fbc9d432187bd948eba upstream.

Sequential write IOs were tested with bs=1M by FIO in writeback cache
mode, these IOs were expected to be bypassed, but actually they did not.
We debug the code, and find in check_should_bypass():
    if (!congested &&
        mode == CACHE_MODE_WRITEBACK &&
        op_is_write(bio_op(bio)) &&
        (bio-ï¼žbi_opf & REQ_SYNC))
        goto rescale
that means, If in writeback mode, a write IO with REQ_SYNC flag will not
be bypassed though it is a sequential large IO, It's not a correct thing
to do actually, so this patch remove these codes.
