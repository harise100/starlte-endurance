Subject: i2c: jz4780: drop superfluous init

From: Wolfram Sang <wsa@the-dreams.de>

commit 27bfeb5a0619554d9734fb39e14f0e80fa7c342c upstream.

David reported that the length for memset was incorrect (element sizes
were not taken into account). Then I saw that we are clearing kzalloced
memory, so we can simply drop this code.
