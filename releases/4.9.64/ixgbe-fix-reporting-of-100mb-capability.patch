Subject: ixgbe: Fix reporting of 100Mb capability

From: Tony Nguyen <anthony.l.nguyen@intel.com>


[ Upstream commit f215266470dfe86196a31fe0725a86cea77f9a18 ]

BaseT adapters that are capable of supporting 100Mb are not reporting this
capability.  This patch corrects the reporting so that 100Mb is shown as
supported on those adapters.
