Subject: [PATCH -stable] arm: crypto: reduce priority of bit-sliced AES cipher

[ Not upstream because this is a minimal fix for a bug where arm32
  kernels can use a much slower implementation of AES than is actually
  available, potentially forcing vendors to disable encryption on their
  devices.]

All the aes-bs (bit-sliced) and aes-ce (cryptographic extensions)
algorithms had a priority of 300.  This is undesirable because it means
an aes-bs algorithm may be used when an aes-ce algorithm is available.
The aes-ce algorithms have much better performance (up to 10x faster).

Fix it by decreasing the priority of the aes-bs algorithms to 250.

This was fixed upstream by commit cc477bf64573 ("crypto: arm/aes -
replace bit-sliced OpenSSL NEON code"), but it was just a small part of
a complete rewrite.  This patch just fixes the priority bug for older
kernels.
