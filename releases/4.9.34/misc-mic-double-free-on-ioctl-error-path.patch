Subject: misc: mic: double free on ioctl error path

From: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>

commit 816c9311f1144a03da1fdc4feb2f6b0d3299fca0 upstream.

This function only has one caller.  Freeing "vdev" here leads to a use
after free bug.  There are several other error paths in this function
but this is the only one which frees "vdev".  It looks like the kfree()
can be safely removed.

Fixes: 61e9c905df78 ("misc: mic: Enable VOP host side functionality")
