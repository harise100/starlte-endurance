Subject: usb: misc: usb3503: make sure reset is low for at least 100us

From: Stefan Agner <stefan@agner.ch>

commit b8626f1dc29d3eee444bfaa92146ec7b291ef41c upstream.

When using a GPIO which is high by default, and initialize the
driver in USB Hub mode, initialization fails with:
  [  111.757794] usb3503 0-0008: SP_ILOCK failed (-5)

The reason seems to be that the chip is not properly reset.
Probe does initialize reset low, however some lines later the
code already set it back high, which is not long enouth.

Make sure reset is asserted for at least 100us by inserting a
delay after initializing the reset pin during probe.
