Subject: V4L/DVB (10218): cx23885: Fix Oops for mixed install of analog and digital only cards

From: Andy Walls <awalls@radix.net>

commit cd8f894eacf13996d920fdd2aef1afc55156b191 upstream.

Analog support for HVR-1250 has not been completed, but does exist for
the HVR-1800.

Since both cards use the same driver, it tries to create the analog
dev for both devices, which is not possible.

This causes a NULL error to show up in video_open and mpeg_open.

-Mark

Iterations through the cx23885_devlist must check for NULL
pointers as some supported devices only have DVB support at the moment.
Mark Jenks encoutered an Oops in a system with both an HVR-1250 and HVR-1800
installed.

-Andy
