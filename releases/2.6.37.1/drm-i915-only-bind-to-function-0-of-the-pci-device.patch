Subject: drm/i915: Only bind to function 0 of the PCI device

commit 5fe49d86f9d01044abf687a8cd21edef636d58aa upstream.

Early chipsets (gen2/3) used function 1 as a placeholder for multi-head.
We used to ignore these since they were not assigned to
PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY_VGA. However with 934f992c7 we attempt to bind to all
Intel PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY devices (and functions) to work in multi-gpu
systems. This fails hard on gen2/3.
