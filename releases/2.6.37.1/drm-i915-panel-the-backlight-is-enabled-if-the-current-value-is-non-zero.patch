Subject: drm/i915/panel: The backlight is enabled if the current value is non-zero

From: Indan Zupancic <indan@nul.nu>

commit c8303e7f3f3093c16ef0fa5f73280637c89d4368 upstream.

... and not if the maximum is non-zero. This fixes the typo introduced
in 47356eb6728501452 and preserves the backlight value from boot.

[ickle: My thanks also to Indan Zupancic for diagnosing the original
        regression and suggesting the appropriate fix.]
