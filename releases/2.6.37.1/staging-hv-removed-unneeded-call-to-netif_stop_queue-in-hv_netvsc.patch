Subject: staging: hv: Removed unneeded call to netif_stop_queue() in hv_netvsc

From: Hank Janssen <hjanssen@microsoft.com>

commit a786f915274ba446865a996515c7790a930f04dd upstream.

Removed the call to netif_stop_queue() in netvsc_probe() as
the queue is not initialized at that point and further call
to it after queue initialization is really not necessary.

This change was prompted after an upstream change went into
2.6.37 (netif_tx_stop_queue) that now checks if netif_stop_queue
is called before register with netdev is done.

This will eliminate the warning message to the log when hv_netvsc
driver starts up.
