Subject: [SCSI] mpt2sas: fix internal device reset for older firmware prior to MPI Rev K

From: Kashyap, Desai <kashyap.desai@lsi.com>

commit efe82a16bc0f9f9e1fc8fa706eb0309fcd57770a upstream.

The "internal device reset complete" event is not supported
for older firmware prior to MPI Rev K We added
a check in the driver so the "internal device reset" event is
ignored for older firmware.  When ignored, the tm_busy flag doesn't
get set nor cleared.  Without this fix, IO queues would be froozen
indefinetly after the "internal device reset" event, as the "complete" event
never sent to clear the flag.
