Subject: ALSA: hda - Fix memory leaks in conexant jack arrays

From: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>

commit 70f7db11c45a313b23922cacf248c613c3b2144c upstream.

The Conexant codec driver adds the jack arrays in init callback which
may be called also in each PM resume.  This results in the addition of
new jack element at each time.

The fix is to check whether the requested jack is already present in
the array.
