Subject: Fix prlimit64 for suid/sgid processes

From: Kacper Kornet <kornet@camk.edu.pl>

commit aa5bd67dcfdf9af34c7fa36ebc87d4e1f7e91873 upstream.

Since check_prlimit_permission always fails in the case of SUID/GUID
processes, such processes are not able to read or set their own limits.
This commit changes this by assuming that process can always read/change
its own limits.
