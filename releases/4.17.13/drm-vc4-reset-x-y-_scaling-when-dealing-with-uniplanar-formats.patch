Subject: drm/vc4: Reset ->{x, y}_scaling[1] when dealing with uniplanar formats

From: Boris Brezillon <boris.brezillon@bootlin.com>

commit a6a00918d4ad8718c3ccde38c02cec17f116b2fd upstream.

This is needed to ensure ->is_unity is correct when the plane was
previously configured to output a multi-planar format with scaling
enabled, and is then being reconfigured to output a uniplanar format.

Fixes: fc04023fafec ("drm/vc4: Add support for YUV planes.")
