The symlink /proc/<pid>/ns/{ipc,mnt,net,pid,user,uts} point to
dentries allocated with d_alloc_pseudo that we can mount, and
that have interesting names printed out with d_dname.

When these files are bind mounted /proc/mounts is not currently
displaying the mount point correctly because d_dname is called instead
of just displaying the path where the file is mounted.

Solve this by adding an explicit check to distinguish mounted pseudo
inodes and unmounted pseudo inodes.  Unmounted pseudo inodes always
use mount of their filesstem as the mnt_root  in their path making
these two cases easy to distinguish.
