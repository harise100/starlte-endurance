Subject: ath5k: write PCU registers on initial reset

From: Bob Copeland <me@bobcopeland.com>

commit 3355443ad7601991affa5992b0d53870335af765 upstream.

"Ath5k: unify resets"
introduced a regression into 2.6.28 where the PCU registers are never
initialized, due to ath5k_reset() always passing true for change_channel.
We subsequently program a lot of these registers but several may start
in an unknown state.
