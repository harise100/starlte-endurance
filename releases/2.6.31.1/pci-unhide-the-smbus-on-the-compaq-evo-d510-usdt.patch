Subject: PCI: Unhide the SMBus on the Compaq Evo D510 USDT

From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>

commit 6b5096e4d4496e185cd1ada5d1b8e1d941c805ed upstream.

One more form factor for Compaq Evo D510, which needs the same quirk
as the other form factors. Apparently there's no hardware monitoring
chip on that one, but SPD EEPROMs, so it's still worth unhiding the
SMBus.
