Subject: asix: Fix typo for AX88772 PHY Selection

The attached patch fixes a PHY selection problem that prevents AX88772
based devices (Linksys USB200Mv2, etc) devices from working.  The
interface comes up and everything seems fine except the device doesn't
send/receive any packets.  The one-liner attached fixes this issue and
makes the devices usable again.

Patch has already been applied for 2.6.20+ kernels but it would be very
helpful for end-users/distributions to have this fixed in the 2.6.19
series as well.
