Subject: Fix memory corruption in console selection

From: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>

commit 878b8619f711280fd05845e21956434b5e588cc4 upstream.

Fix an off-by-two memory error in console selection.

The loop below goes from sel_start to sel_end (inclusive), so it writes
one more character.  This one more character was added to the allocated
size (+1), but it was not multiplied by an UTF-8 multiplier.

This patch fixes a memory corruption when UTF-8 console is used and the
user selects a few characters, all of them 3-byte in UTF-8 (for example
a frame line).

When memory redzones are enabled, a redzone corruption is reported.
When they are not enabled, trashing of random memory occurs.
