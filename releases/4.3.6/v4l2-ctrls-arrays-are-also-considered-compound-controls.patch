Subject: [media] v4l2-ctrls: arrays are also considered compound controls

From: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com>

commit 35204e2e84f2dae72012f8ca319659c12f428430 upstream.

Array controls weren't skipped when only V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_CTRL was
provided (so no V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_NEXT_COMPOUND was set). This is wrong
since arrays are also considered compound controls (i.e. with more than
one value), and applications that do not know about arrays will not
be able to handle such controls.

Fix the test to include arrays.
