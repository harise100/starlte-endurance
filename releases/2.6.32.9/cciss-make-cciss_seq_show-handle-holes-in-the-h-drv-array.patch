Subject: cciss: Make cciss_seq_show handle holes in the h->drv[] array

From: Stephen M. Cameron <scameron@beardog.cce.hp.com>

commit 531c2dc70d339c5dfa8c3eb628c3459dc6f3a075 upstream.

It is possible (and expected) for there to be holes in the h->drv[]
array, that is, some elements may be NULL pointers.  cciss_seq_show
needs to be made aware of this possibility to avoid an Oops.

To reproduce the Oops which this fixes:

1) Create two "arrays" in the Array Configuratino Utility and
   several logical drives on each array.
2) cat /proc/driver/cciss/cciss* in an infinite loop
3) delete some of the logical drives in the first "array."
