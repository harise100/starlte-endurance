Subject: ahci: add Acer G725 to broken suspend list

commit cedc9bf906dae044443d403371c887affdb44168 upstream.

Acer G725 shares the same suspend problem with the HP laptops which
lose ATA devices on resume.  New firmware which fixes the problem is
already available.  Add G725 with old firmwares to the broken suspend
list.

This problem has been reported in bko#15104.
