Subject: hwmon: (adt7462) Wrong ADT7462_VOLT_COUNT

From: Ray Copeland <ray.copeland@aprius.com>

commit 85f8d3e5faea8bd36c3e5196f8334f7db45e19b2 upstream.

The #define ADT7462_VOLT_COUNT is wrong, it should be 13 not 12. All the
for loops that use this as a limit count are of the typical form, "for
(n = 0; n < ADT7462_VOLT_COUNT; n++)", so to loop through all voltages
w/o missing the last one it is necessary for the count to be one greater
than it is.  (Specifically, you will miss the +1.5V 3GPIO input with count
= 12 vs. 13.)
