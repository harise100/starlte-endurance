Subject: V4L/DVB: dvb-core: fix initialization of feeds list in demux filter

From: Francesco Lavra <francescolavra@interfree.it>

commit 691c9ae099b9bcb5c27125af00a4a90120977458 upstream.

A DVB demultiplexer device can be used to set up either a PES filter or
a section filter. In the former case, the ts field of the feed union of
struct dmxdev_filter is used, in the latter case the sec field of the
same union is used.
The ts field is a struct list_head, and is currently initialized in the
open() method of the demux device. When for a given demuxer a section
filter is set up, the sec field is played with, thus if a PES filter
needs to be set up after that the ts field will be corrupted, causing a
kernel oops.
This fix moves the list head initialization to
dvb_dmxdev_pes_filter_set(), so that the ts field is properly
initialized every time a PES filter is set up.
