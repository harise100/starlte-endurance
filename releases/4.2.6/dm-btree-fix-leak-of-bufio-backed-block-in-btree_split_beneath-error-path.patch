Subject: dm btree: fix leak of bufio-backed block in btree_split_beneath error path

From: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>

commit 4dcb8b57df3593dcb20481d9d6cf79d1dc1534be upstream.

btree_split_beneath()'s error path had an outstanding FIXME that speaks
directly to the potential for _not_ cleaning up a previously allocated
bufio-backed block.

Fix this by releasing the previously allocated bufio block using
unlock_block().
