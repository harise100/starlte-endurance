Subject: clk: rockchip: Fix wrong parent for SDMMC phase clock for rk3228

From: Shawn Lin <shawn.lin@rock-chips.com>

[ Upstream commit 4b0556a441dd37e598887215bc89b49a6ef525b3 ]

commit c420c1e4db22 ("clk: rockchip: Prevent calculating mmc phase
if clock rate is zero") catches one gremlin again for clk-rk3228.c
that the parent of SDMMC phase clock should be sclk_sdmmc0, but not
sclk_sdmmc. However, the naming of the sdmmc clocks varies in the
manual with the card clock having the 0 while the hclk is named
without appended 0. So standardize one one format to prevent
confusion, as there also is only one (non-sdio) mmc controller on
the soc.
