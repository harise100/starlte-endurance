Subject: misc: atmel_pwm: add deferred-probing support

From: Johan Hovold <jhovold@gmail.com>

commit 5c6d6fd1564138ad048564e48639f842714a90c6 upstream.

Two drivers (atmel-pwm-bl and leds-atmel-pwm) currently depend on the
atmel_pwm driver to have bound to any pwm-device before their devices
are probed.

Support deferred probing of such devices by making sure to return
-EPROBE_DEFER from pwm_channel_alloc when no pwm-device has yet been
bound.
