Subject: USB: storage: Add quirk for Adaptec USBConnect 2000 USB-to-SCSI Adapter

From: Mark <markk@clara.co.uk>

commit 67d365a57a51fb9dece6a5ceb504aa381cae1e5b upstream.

The Adaptec USBConnect 2000 is another SCSI-USB converter which uses
Shuttle Technology/SCM Microsystems chips. The US_FL_SCM_MULT_TARG quirk is
required to use SCSI devices with ID other than 0.

I don't have a USBConnect 2000, but based on the other entries for Shuttle/
SCM-based converters this patch is very likely correct. I used 0x0000 and
0x9999 for bcdDeviceMin and bcdDeviceMax because I'm not sure which
bcdDevice value the product uses.
