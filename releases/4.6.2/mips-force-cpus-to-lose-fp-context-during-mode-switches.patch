Subject: MIPS: Force CPUs to lose FP context during mode switches

From: Paul Burton <paul.burton@imgtec.com>

commit 6b8322576e9d325b65c54fbef64e4e8690ad70ce upstream.

Commit 9791554b45a2 ("MIPS,prctl: add PR_[GS]ET_FP_MODE prctl options
for MIPS") added support for the PR_SET_FP_MODE prctl, which allows a
userland program to modify its FP mode at runtime. This is most notably
required if dynamic linking leads to the FP mode requirement changing at
runtime from that indicated in the initial executable's ELF header. In
order to avoid overhead in the general FP context restore code, it aimed
to have threads in the process become unable to enable the FPU during a
mode switch & have the thread calling the prctl syscall wait for all
other threads in the process to be context switched at least once. Once
that happens we can know that no thread in the process whose mode will
be switched has live FP context, and it's safe to perform the mode
switch. However in the (rare) case of modeswitches occurring in
multithreaded programs this can lead to indeterminate delays for the
thread invoking the prctl syscall, and the code monitoring for those
context switches was woefully inadequate for all but the simplest cases.

Fix this by broadcasting an IPI if other CPUs may have live FP context
for an affected thread, with a handler causing those CPUs to relinquish
their FPU ownership. Threads will then be allowed to continue running
but will stall on the wait_on_atomic_t in enable_restore_fp_context if
they attempt to use FP again whilst the mode switch is still in
progress. The end result is less fragile poking at scheduler context
switch counts & a more expedient completion of the mode switch.
