Subject: ARM: dts: sunxi: Adjust touchscreen compatible for sun5i and later

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>

commit 8bf1b9b3d90194a174493febc731f7783f2adf1a upstream.

The touchscreen controller in the A13 and later has a different temperature
curve than the one in the original A10, change the compatible for the A13 and
later so that the kernel will use the correct curve.
