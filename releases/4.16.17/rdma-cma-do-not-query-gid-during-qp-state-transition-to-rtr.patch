Subject: RDMA/cma: Do not query GID during QP state transition to RTR

From: Parav Pandit <parav@mellanox.com>

[ Upstream commit 9aa169213d1166d30ae357a44abbeae93459339d ]

When commit [1] was added, SGID was queried to derive the SMAC address.
Then, later on during a refactor [2], SMAC was no longer needed. However,
the now useless GID query remained.  Then during additional code changes
later on, the GID query was being done in such a way that it caused iWARP
queries to start breaking.  Remove the useless GID query and resolve the
iWARP breakage at the same time.

This is discussed in [3].

[1] commit dd5f03beb4f7 ("IB/core: Ethernet L2 attributes in verbs/cm structures")
[2] commit 5c266b2304fb ("IB/cm: Remove the usage of smac and vid of qp_attr and cm_av")
