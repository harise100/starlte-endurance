Subject: efi/libstub/arm64: Handle randomized TEXT_OFFSET

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 4f74d72aa7067e75af92fbab077e6d7d0210be66 ]

When CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_TEXT_OFFSET=y, TEXT_OFFSET is an arbitrary
multiple of PAGE_SIZE in the interval [0, 2MB).

The EFI stub does not account for the potential misalignment of
TEXT_OFFSET relative to EFI_KIMG_ALIGN, and produces a randomized
physical offset which is always a round multiple of EFI_KIMG_ALIGN.
This may result in statically allocated objects whose alignment exceeds
PAGE_SIZE to appear misaligned in memory. This has been observed to
result in spurious stack overflow reports and failure to make use of
the IRQ stacks, and theoretically could result in a number of other
issues.

We can OR in the low bits of TEXT_OFFSET to ensure that we have the
necessary offset (and hence preserve the misalignment of TEXT_OFFSET
relative to EFI_KIMG_ALIGN), so let's do that.
