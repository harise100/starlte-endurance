Subject: ACPI / PMIC: xpower: Fix power_table addresses

From: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>


[ Upstream commit 2bde7c32b1db162692f05c6be066b5bcd3d9fdbe ]

The power table addresses should be contiguous, but there was a hole
where 0x34 was missing. On most devices this is not a problem as
addresses above 0x34 are used for the BUC# convertors which are not
used in the DSDTs I've access to but after the BUC# convertors
there is a field named GPI1 in the DSTDs, which does get used in some
cases and ended up turning BUC6 on and off due to the wrong addresses,
resulting in turning the entire device off (or causing it to reboot).

Removing the hole in the addresses fixes this, fixing one of my
Bay Trail tablets turning off while booting the mainline kernel.

While at it add comments with the field names used in the DSDTs to
make it easier to compare the register and bits used at each address
with the datasheet.
