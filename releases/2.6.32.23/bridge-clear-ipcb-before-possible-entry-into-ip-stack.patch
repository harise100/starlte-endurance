Subject: bridge: Clear IPCB before possible entry into IP stack


From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>

[ Upstream commit 17762060c25590bfddd68cc1131f28ec720f405f ]

The bridge protocol lives dangerously by having incestuous relations
with the IP stack.  In this instance an abomination has been created
where a bogus IPCB area from a bridged packet leads to a crash in
the IP stack because it's interpreted as IP options.

This patch papers over the problem by clearing the IPCB area in that
particular spot.  To fix this properly we'd also need to parse any
IP options if present but I'm way too lazy for that.
