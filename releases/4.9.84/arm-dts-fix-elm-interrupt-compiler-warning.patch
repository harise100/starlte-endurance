Subject: ARM: dts: Fix elm interrupt compiler warning

From: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>


[ Upstream commit d364b038bc962f494cffb8f6cb6cddbe41bcb5b6 ]

Looks like the interrupt property is missing the controller and level
information causing:

Warning (interrupts_property): interrupts size is (4), expected multiple
of 12 in /ocp/elm@48078000
