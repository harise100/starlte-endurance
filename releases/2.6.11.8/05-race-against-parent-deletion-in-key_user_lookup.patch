This was fixed post-2.6.11.  Can you confirm that 2.6.12-rc2 works OK?

This is the patch we used.  It should go into -stable if it's not already
there.


From: Alexander Nyberg <alexn@dsv.su.se>

I looked at some of the oops reports against keyrings, I think the problem
is that the search isn't restarted after dropping the key_user_lock, *p
will still be NULL when we get back to try_again and look through the tree.

It looks like the intention was that the search start over from scratch.
