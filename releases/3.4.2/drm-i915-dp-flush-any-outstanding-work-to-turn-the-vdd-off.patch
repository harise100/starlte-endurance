Subject: drm/i915/dp: Flush any outstanding work to turn the VDD off

From: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

commit 17038de5f16569a25343cf68668f3b657eafb00e upstream.

As we may kick off a delayed workqueue task to switch of the VDD lines, we
need to complete that task prior to turning off the panel (which itself
depends upon VDD being off).

v2: Don't cancel the outstanding work as this may trigger a deadlock
