Subject: workqueue: ensure @task is valid across kthread_stop()

From: Lai Jiangshan <laijs@cn.fujitsu.com>

commit 5bdfff96c69a4d5ab9c49e60abf9e070ecd2acbb upstream.

When a kworker should die, the kworkre is notified through WORKER_DIE
flag instead of kthread_should_stop().  This, IIRC, is primarily to
keep the test synchronized inside worker_pool lock.  WORKER_DIE is
first set while holding pool->lock, the lock is dropped and
kthread_stop() is called.

Unfortunately, this means that there's a slight chance that the target
kworker may see WORKER_DIE before kthread_stop() finishes and exits
and frees the target task before or during kthread_stop().

Fix it by pinning the target task before setting WORKER_DIE and
putting it after kthread_stop() is done.

tj: Improved patch description and comment.  Moved pinning above
    WORKER_DIE for better signify what it's protecting.
