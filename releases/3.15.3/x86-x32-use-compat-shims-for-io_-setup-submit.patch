Subject: x86, x32: Use compat shims for io_{setup,submit}

From: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

commit 7fd44dacdd803c0bbf38bf478d51d280902bb0f1 upstream.

The io_setup takes a pointer to a context id of type aio_context_t.
This in turn is typed to a __kernel_ulong_t.  We could tweak the
exported headers to define this as a 64bit quantity for specific
ABIs, but since we already have a 32bit compat shim for the x86 ABI,
let's just re-use that logic.  The libaio package is also written to
expect this as a pointer type, so a compat shim would simplify that.

The io_submit func operates on an array of pointers to iocb structs.
Padding out the array to be 64bit aligned is a huge pain, so convert
it over to the existing compat shim too.

We don't convert io_getevents to the compat func as its only purpose
is to handle the timespec struct, and the x32 ABI uses 64bit times.

With this change, the libaio package can now pass its testsuite when
built for the x32 ABI.
