Subject: arm64: mm: remove broken &= operator from pmd_mknotpresent

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

commit e3a920afc3482e954834a4ed95908c4bc5e4c000 upstream.

This should be a plain old '&' and could easily lead to undefined
behaviour if the target of a pmd_mknotpresent invocation was the same
as the parameter.

Fixes: 9c7e535fcc17 (arm64: mm: Route pmd thp functions through pte equivalents)
