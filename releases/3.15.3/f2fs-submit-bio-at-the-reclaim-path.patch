Subject: f2fs: submit bio at the reclaim path

From: Jaegeuk Kim <jaegeuk.kim@samsung.com>

commit 2aea39eca6b68d6ae7eb545332df0695f56a3d3f upstream.

If f2fs_write_data_page is called through the reclaim path, we should submit
the bio right away.

This patch resolves the following issue that Marc Dietrich reported.
"It took me a while to bisect a problem which causes my ARM (tegra2) netbook to
frequently stall for 5-10 seconds when I enable EXA acceleration (opentegra
experimental ddx)."
And this patch fixes that.
