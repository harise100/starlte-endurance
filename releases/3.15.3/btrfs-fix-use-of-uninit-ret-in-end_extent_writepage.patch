Subject: btrfs: fix use of uninit "ret" in end_extent_writepage()

From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

commit 3e2426bd0eb980648449e7a2f5a23e3cd3c7725c upstream.

If this condition in end_extent_writepage() is false:

	if (tree->ops && tree->ops->writepage_end_io_hook)

we will then test an uninitialized "ret" at:

	ret = ret < 0 ? ret : -EIO;

The test for ret is for the case where ->writepage_end_io_hook
failed, and we'd choose that ret as the error; but if
there is no ->writepage_end_io_hook, nothing sets ret.

Initializing ret to 0 should be sufficient; if
writepage_end_io_hook wasn't set, (!uptodate) means
non-zero err was passed in, so we choose -EIO in that case.
