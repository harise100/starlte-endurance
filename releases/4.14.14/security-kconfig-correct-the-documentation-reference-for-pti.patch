Subject: security/Kconfig: Correct the Documentation reference for PTI

From: W. Trevor King <wking@tremily.us>

commit a237f762681e2a394ca67f21df2feb2b76a3609b upstream.

When the config option for PTI was added a reference to documentation was
added as well. But the documentation did not exist at that point. The final
documentation has a different file name.

Fix it up to point to the proper file.
