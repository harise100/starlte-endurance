Subject: cifs: Allow passwords which begin with a delimitor

From: Sachin Prabhu <sprabhu@redhat.com>

commit c369c9a4a7c82d33329d869cbaf93304cc7a0c40 upstream.

Fixes a regression in cifs_parse_mount_options where a password
which begins with a delimitor is parsed incorrectly as being a blank
password.
