Subject: selftests: intel_pstate: return Kselftest Skip code for skipped tests

From: "Shuah Khan (Samsung OSG)" <shuah@kernel.org>

[ Upstream commit 5c30a038fb8ec8cdff011e6b5d5d51eb415381d4 ]

When intel_pstate test is skipped because of unmet dependencies and/or
unsupported configuration, it returns 0 which is treated as a pass
by the Kselftest framework. This leads to false positive result even
when the test could not be run.

Change it to return kselftest skip code when a test gets skipped to
clearly report that the test could not be run.

Kselftest framework SKIP code is 4 and the framework prints appropriate
messages to indicate that the test is skipped.
