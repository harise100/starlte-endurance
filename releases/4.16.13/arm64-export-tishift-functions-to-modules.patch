Subject: arm64: export tishift functions to modules

From: Jason A. Donenfeld <Jason@zx2c4.com>

commit 255845fc43a3aaf806852a1d3bc89bff1411ebe3 upstream.

Otherwise modules that use these arithmetic operations will fail to
link. We accomplish this with the usual EXPORT_SYMBOL, which on most
architectures goes in the .S file but the ARM64 maintainers prefer that
insead it goes into arm64ksyms.

While we're at it, we also fix this up to use SPDX, and I personally
choose to relicense this as GPL2||BSD so that these symbols don't need
to be export_symbol_gpl, so all modules can use the routines, since
these are important general purpose compiler-generated function calls.
