Subject: drm/amdgpu: disable GFX ring and disable PQ wptr in hw_fini

From: Monk Liu <Monk.Liu@amd.com>

[ Upstream commit 9f0178fb67699992d38601cb923b434f9986dd68 ]

otherwise there will be DMAR reading error comes out from CP since
GFX is still alive and CPC's WPTR_POLL is still enabled, which would
lead to DMAR read error.

fix:
we can hault CPG after hw_fini, but cannot halt CPC becaues KIQ
stil need to be alive to let RLCV invoke, but its WPTR_POLL could
be disabled.
