Subject: x86/apic: Set up through-local-APIC mode on the boot CPU if 'noapic' specified

From: Baoquan He <bhe@redhat.com>

[ Upstream commit bee3204ec3c49f6f53add9c3962c9012a5c036fa ]

Currently the kdump kernel becomes very slow if 'noapic' is specified.
Normal kernel doesn't have this bug.

Kernel parameter 'noapic' is used to disable IO-APIC in system for
testing or special purpose. Here the root cause is that in kdump
kernel LAPIC is disabled since commit:

  522e664644 ("x86/apic: Disable I/O APIC before shutdown of the local APIC")

In this case we need set up through-local-APIC on boot CPU in
setup_local_APIC().

In normal kernel the legacy irq mode is enabled by the BIOS. If
it is virtual wire mode, the local-APIC has been enabled and set as
through-local-APIC.

Though we fixed the regression introduced by commit 522e664644,
to further improve robustness set up the through-local-APIC mode
explicitly, do not rely on the default boot IRQ mode.
