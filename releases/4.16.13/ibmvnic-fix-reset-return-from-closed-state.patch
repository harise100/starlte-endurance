Subject: ibmvnic: Fix reset return from closed state

From: John Allen <jallen@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

[ Upstream commit e676d81c8990f511d60698a1a8abaa438b3f9d3d ]

The case in which we handle a reset from the state where the device is
closed seems to be bugged for all types of reset. For most types of reset
we currently exit the reset routine correctly, but don't set the state to
indicate that we are back in the "closed" state. For some specific cases,
we don't exit the reset routine at all and resetting will cause a closed
device to be opened.

This patch fixes the problem by unconditionally checking the reset_state
and correctly setting the adapter state before returning.
