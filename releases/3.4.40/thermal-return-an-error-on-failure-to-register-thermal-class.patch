Subject: thermal: return an error on failure to register thermal class

From: Richard Guy Briggs <rbriggs@redhat.com>

commit da28d966f6aa942ae836d09729f76a1647932309 upstream.

The return code from the registration of the thermal class is used to
unallocate resources, but this failure isn't passed back to the caller of
thermal_init.  Return this failure back to the caller.

This bug was introduced in changeset 4cb18728 which overwrote the return code
when the variable was re-used to catch the return code of the registration of
the genetlink thermal socket family.
