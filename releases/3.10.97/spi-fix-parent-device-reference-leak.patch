Subject: spi: fix parent-device reference leak

From: Johan Hovold <johan@kernel.org>

commit 157f38f993919b648187ba341bfb05d0e91ad2f6 upstream.

Fix parent-device reference leak due to SPI-core taking an unnecessary
reference to the parent when allocating the master structure, a
reference that was never released.

Note that driver core takes its own reference to the parent when the
master device is registered.

Fixes: 49dce689ad4e ("spi doesn't need class_device")
