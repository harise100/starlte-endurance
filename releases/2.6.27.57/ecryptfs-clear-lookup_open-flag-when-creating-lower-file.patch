Subject: eCryptfs: Clear LOOKUP_OPEN flag when creating lower file

From: Tyler Hicks <tyhicks@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

commit 2e21b3f124eceb6ab5a07c8a061adce14ac94e14 upstream.

eCryptfs was passing the LOOKUP_OPEN flag through to the lower file
system, even though ecryptfs_create() doesn't support the flag. A valid
filp for the lower filesystem could be returned in the nameidata if the
lower file system's create() function supported LOOKUP_OPEN, possibly
resulting in unencrypted writes to the lower file.

However, this is only a potential problem in filesystems (FUSE, NFS,
CIFS, CEPH, 9p) that eCryptfs isn't known to support today.
