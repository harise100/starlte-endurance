Subject: autofs - remove autofs dentry mount check

From: David Jeffery <djeffery@redhat.com>

commit ce8a5dbdf9e709bdaf4618d7ef8cceb91e8adc69 upstream.

When checking if an autofs mount point is busy it isn't sufficient to
only check if it's a mount point.

For example, if the mount of an offset mountpoint in a tree is denied
for this host by its export and the dentry becomes a process working
directory the check incorrectly returns the mount as not in use at
expire.

This can happen since the default when mounting within a tree is
nostrict, which means ingnore mount fails on mounts within the tree and
continue.  The nostrict option is meant to allow mounting in this case.
