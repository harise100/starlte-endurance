Subject: regulator: core: Change dummy supplies error message to a warning

From: Shuah Khan <shuah.kh@samsung.com>

commit acc3d5cec84f82ebea535fa0bd9500ac3df2aee9 upstream.

Change "dummy supplies not allowed" error message to warning instead, as this
is a just warning message with no change to the behavior.

[Added a CC to stable since some other bug fixes cause this to come up
more frequently on PCs which is how it was noticed -- broonie]
