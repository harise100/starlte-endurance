Subject: libata: use wider match for blacklisting Crucial M500

From: Tejun Heo <tj@kernel.org>

commit 83493d7e782d2630f1a55def14a79f0e7c4faac3 upstream.

We're now blacklisting "Crucial_CT???M500SSD1" and
"Crucial_CT???M500SSD3".  Also, "Micron_M500*" is blacklisted which is
about the same devices as the crucial branded ones.  Let's merge the
two Crucial M500 entries and widen the match to
"Crucial_CT???M500SSD*" so that we don't have to fiddle with new
entries for similar devices.
