Subject: memcg: reparent charges of children before processing parent

From: Filipe Brandenburger <filbranden@google.com>

commit 4fb1a86fb5e4209a7d4426d4e586c58e9edc74ac upstream.

Sometimes the cleanup after memcg hierarchy testing gets stuck in
mem_cgroup_reparent_charges(), unable to bring non-kmem usage down to 0.

There may turn out to be several causes, but a major cause is this: the
workitem to offline parent can get run before workitem to offline child;
parent's mem_cgroup_reparent_charges() circles around waiting for the
child's pages to be reparented to its lrus, but it's holding
cgroup_mutex which prevents the child from reaching its
mem_cgroup_reparent_charges().

Further testing showed that an ordered workqueue for cgroup_destroy_wq
is not always good enough: percpu_ref_kill_and_confirm's call_rcu_sched
stage on the way can mess up the order before reaching the workqueue.

Instead, when offlining a memcg, call mem_cgroup_reparent_charges() on
all its children (and grandchildren, in the correct order) to have their
charges reparented first.
