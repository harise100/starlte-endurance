Subject: x86, vmi: put a missing paravirt_release_pmd in pgd_dtor

From: Alok Kataria <akataria@vmware.com>

commit 55a8ba4b7f76bebd7e8ce3f74c04b140627a1bad upstream.

Commit 6194ba6ff6ccf8d5c54c857600843c67aa82c407 ("x86: don't special-case
pmd allocations as much") made changes to the way we handle pmd allocations,
and while doing that it dropped a call to  paravirt_release_pd on the
pgd page from the pgd_dtor code path.

As a result of this missing release, the hypervisor is now unaware of the
pgd page being freed, and as a result it ends up tracking this page as a
page table page.

After this the guest may start using the same page for other purposes, and
depending on what use the page is put to, it may result in various performance
and/or functional issues ( hangs, reboots).

Since this release is only required for VMI, I now release the pgd page from
the (vmi)_pgd_free hook.
