Subject: nbd: fix I/O hang on disconnected nbds

From: Paul Clements <paul.clements@steeleye.com>

commit 4d48a542b42747c36a5937447d9c3de7c897ea50 upstream.

Fix a problem that causes I/O to a disconnected (or partially initialized)
nbd device to hang indefinitely.  To reproduce:

# ioctl NBD_SET_SIZE_BLOCKS /dev/nbd23 514048
# dd if=/dev/nbd23 of=/dev/null bs=4096 count=1

...hangs...

This can also occur when an nbd device loses its nbd-client/server
connection.  Although we clear the queue of any outstanding I/Os after the
client/server connection fails, any additional I/Os that get queued later
will hang.

This bug may also be the problem reported in this bug report:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12277

Testing would need to be performed to determine if the two issues are the
same.

This problem was introduced by the new request handling thread code ("NBD:
allow nbd to be used locally", 3/2008), which entered into mainline around
2.6.25.

The fix, which is fairly simple, is to restore the check for lo->sock
being NULL in do_nbd_request.  This causes I/O to an uninitialized nbd to
immediately fail with an I/O error, as it did prior to the introduction of
this bug.
