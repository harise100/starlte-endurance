Subject: media: dmxdev: fix error code for invalid ioctls

From: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@s-opensource.com>

[ Upstream commit a145f64c6107d3aa5a7cec9f8977d04ac2a896c9 ]

Returning -EINVAL when an ioctl is not implemented is a very
bad idea, as it is hard to distinguish from other error
contitions that an ioctl could lead. Replace it by its
right error code: -ENOTTY.
