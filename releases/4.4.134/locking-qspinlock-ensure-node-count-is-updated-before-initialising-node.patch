Subject: locking/qspinlock: Ensure node->count is updated before initialising node

From: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>

[ Upstream commit 11dc13224c975efcec96647a4768a6f1bb7a19a8 ]

When queuing on the qspinlock, the count field for the current CPU's head
node is incremented. This needn't be atomic because locking in e.g. IRQ
context is balanced and so an IRQ will return with node->count as it
found it.

However, the compiler could in theory reorder the initialisation of
node[idx] before the increment of the head node->count, causing an
IRQ to overwrite the initialised node and potentially corrupt the lock
state.

Avoid the potential for this harmful compiler reordering by placing a
barrier() between the increment of the head node->count and the subsequent
node initialisation.
