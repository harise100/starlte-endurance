Subject: scsi: bnx2fc: Fix check in SCSI completion handler for timed out request

From: Chad Dupuis <chad.dupuis@cavium.com>

[ Upstream commit ecf7ff49945f5741fa1da112f994939f942031d3 ]

When a request times out we set the io_req flag BNX2FC_FLAG_IO_COMPL so
that if a subsequent completion comes in on that task ID we will ignore
it.  The issue is that in the check for this flag there is a missing
return so we will continue to process a request which may have already
been returned to the ownership of the SCSI layer.  This can cause
unpredictable results.

Solution is to add in the missing return.
