Subject: usb: musb: fix enumeration after resume

From: Andreas Kemnade <andreas@kemnade.info>

[ Upstream commit 17539f2f4f0b7fa906b508765c8ada07a1e45f52 ]

On dm3730 there are enumeration problems after resume.
Investigation led to the cause that the MUSB_POWER_SOFTCONN
bit is not set. If it was set before suspend (because it
was enabled via musb_pullup()), it is set in
musb_restore_context() so the pullup is enabled. But then
musb_start() is called which overwrites MUSB_POWER and
therefore disables MUSB_POWER_SOFTCONN, so no pullup is
enabled and the device is not enumerated.

So let's do a subset of what musb_start() does
in the same way as musb_suspend() does it. Platform-specific
stuff it still called as there might be some phy-related stuff
which needs to be enabled.
Also interrupts are enabled, as it was the original idea
of calling musb_start() in musb_resume() according to
Commit 6fc6f4b87cb3 ("usb: musb: Disable interrupts on suspend,
enable them on resume")
