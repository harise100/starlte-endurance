Subject: complete e390f9a port for v4.9.106
To: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org, oberon <oberon@manjaro.org>

From: "Philip Müller" <philm@manjaro.org>

objtool ports introduced in v4.9.106 were not totally complete. Therefore
they resulted in issues like:

  module: overflow in relocation type 10 val XXXXXXXXXXX
  ‘usbcore’ likely not compiled with -mcmodel=kernel
  module: overflow in relocation type 10 val XXXXXXXXXXX
  ‘scsi_mod’ likely not compiled with -mcmodel=kernel

Missing part was the complete backport of commit e390f9a.

Original notes by Josh Poimboeuf:

The '__unreachable' and '__func_stack_frame_non_standard' sections are
only used at compile time.  They're discarded for vmlinux but they
should also be discarded for modules.

Since this is a recurring pattern, prefix the section names with
".discard.".  It's a nice convention and vmlinux.lds.h already discards
such sections.

Also remove the 'a' (allocatable) flag from the __unreachable section
since it doesn't make sense for a discarded section.
