Subject: HID: core: Avoid uninitialized buffer access

From: Richard Purdie <richard.purdie@linuxfoundation.org>

commit 79b568b9d0c7c5d81932f4486d50b38efdd6da6d upstream.

hid_connect adds various strings to the buffer but they're all
conditional. You can find circumstances where nothing would be written
to it but the kernel will still print the supposedly empty buffer with
printk. This leads to corruption on the console/in the logs.

Ensure buf is initialized to an empty string.
