Subject: nl80211: Add a missing break in parse_station_flags

From: Bernd Edlinger <bernd.edlinger@hotmail.de>

[ Upstream commit 5cf3006cc81d9aa09a10aa781fc065546b12919d ]

I was looking at usually suppressed gcc warnings,
[-Wimplicit-fallthrough=] in this case:

The code definitely looks like a break is missing here.
However I am not able to test the NL80211_IFTYPE_MESH_POINT,
nor do I actually know what might be :)
So please use this patch with caution and only if you are
able to do some testing.

[johannes: looks obvious enough to apply as is, interesting
 though that it never seems to have been a problem]
