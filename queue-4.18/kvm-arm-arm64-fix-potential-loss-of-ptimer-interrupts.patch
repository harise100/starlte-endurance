Subject: KVM: arm/arm64: Fix potential loss of ptimer interrupts

From: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@arm.com>

commit 7afc4ddbf299a13aaf28406783d141a34c6b4f5a upstream.

kvm_timer_update_state() is called when changing the phys timer
configuration registers, either via vcpu reset, as a result of a trap
from the guest, or when userspace programs the registers.

phys_timer_emulate() is in turn called by kvm_timer_update_state() to
either cancel an existing software timer, or program a new software
timer, to emulate the behavior of a real phys timer, based on the change
in configuration registers.

Unfortunately, the interaction between these two functions left a small
race; if the conceptual emulated phys timer should actually fire, but
the soft timer hasn't executed its callback yet, we cancel the timer in
phys_timer_emulate without injecting an irq.  This only happens if the
check in kvm_timer_update_state is called before the timer should fire,
which is relatively unlikely, but possible.

The solution is to update the state of the phys timer after calling
phys_timer_emulate, which will pick up the pending timer state and
update the interrupt value.

Note that this leaves the opportunity of raising the interrupt twice,
once in the just-programmed soft timer, and once in
kvm_timer_update_state.  Since this always happens synchronously with
the VCPU execution, there is no harm in this, and the guest ever only
sees a single timer interrupt.
