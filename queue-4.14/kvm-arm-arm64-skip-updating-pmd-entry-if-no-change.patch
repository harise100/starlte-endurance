Subject: KVM: arm/arm64: Skip updating PMD entry if no change

From: Punit Agrawal <punit.agrawal@arm.com>

commit 86658b819cd0a9aa584cd84453ed268a6f013770 upstream.

Contention on updating a PMD entry by a large number of vcpus can lead
to duplicate work when handling stage 2 page faults. As the page table
update follows the break-before-make requirement of the architecture,
it can lead to repeated refaults due to clearing the entry and
flushing the tlbs.

This problem is more likely when -

* there are large number of vcpus
* the mapping is large block mapping

such as when using PMD hugepages (512MB) with 64k pages.

Fix this by skipping the page table update if there is no change in
the entry being updated.
