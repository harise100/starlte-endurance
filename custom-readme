Hey there stranger! Welcome to my actually useful readme that anyone who wants to compile this kernel on their own can use!

--- How I build for my G960F ---

export CROSS_COMPILE=~/kernels/toolchains/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/bin/aarch64-linux-android- (Insert toolchain path here)
export ARCH=arm64
export SUBARCH=arm64
make clean
make mrproper
make exynos9810-starlte_calikernel_defconfig (For G965, replace starlte with star2lte)
make

--- TO DO ---

- Waiting for NK v104 for more changes
- Suggest some changes!
